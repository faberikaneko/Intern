	というのが第一印象なわけだが、細かく見ていくと違いがわかってくる。
	真面目の説明には「誠実」という言葉が使われている。
	それは、うそやいいかげんなことがないっていう所とも重なる。
	一方で、真剣には「誠実」に値する言葉が使われていない。
	元が「本物の刀剣」っていう意味だから、お遊びでやってるわけじゃない、っていうのが派生して今の用法になったのだろう。

	というわけで、意味の違いを意訳を含めつつまとめると、
	真面目→真剣＋社会的に認められているような（既存のシステムや概念を揺るがさない）精神性。
	素直さといえるかもしれない。
	真剣→何か特定の物事に１００％近いエネルギーを注ぐこと。
	遊びではなく取り組んでいること。

	って感じになるんじゃないかな。
	そうなると、「真面目に怠ける」は不可能だけど、「怠けることに真剣になる」は可能になる。
	例えば、テスト勉強の際に、真面目な人間はとにかく勉強する。
	長い時間かけて、いわゆる正攻法的な手法でもって勉強をする。
	長い時間かけて勉強することは一般的に評価されることだし、結果が出れば「努力が報われた」という感覚を演出することができ、やっぱり評価される。
	しかし一方で、真剣な（この場合は勉強が面倒なので楽をすること、怠けることに、と仮定する）人間はできる限り最小の努力で最大の結果を出そうとする。
	だから、どうやれば楽に良い結果を出せるかを模索する。
	そして、勉強にかける時間は真面目な人間よりもずっと少ない。
	勉強に時間を割かないことは一般的にはよく思われない。
	でも勉強自体は効率的なので、結果はちゃんと出る。
	怠けてる人間がそれなりの結果を出すと、真面目な人間が不憫だから、云われのない非難を受けるかもしれない。
	でも、怠けても（勉強時間が少なくても）結果の出せる人間は真剣に怠けているのだから、本来ならば真面目な人間と同じくらい、評価されてもいいはずなんだけどねぇ。
	ｒｙ
	はい、というわけで、自分は真面目になる気なんてさらさらないが、真剣でありたいなあとか思ったりするわけです。
	特に怠けることとか、楽することとか、好きなものに対して。
	いつも自分で考えて行動して、ちゃんと納得できる結果を出したい。
	人生なんてあっという間なんだから、何事も時間をかけずにこなしたい。
	ギターだって最小の努力で最大の結果を出せれば上達は早いでしょ？
	なんか、この記事書いてると、真面目って侮蔑の言葉なんじゃないかって気がしてきた。
	真面目系クズとか、もはや二重にディスられてるじゃん、みたいな。
	ああ～最後の最後で毒を吐いてしまった．．．
