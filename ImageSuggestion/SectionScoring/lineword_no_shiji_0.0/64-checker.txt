	まぁ解らないときは手を動かすに限ると言うことで、佐藤さんの原図を自分なりになぞってみたら．．．理解出来ました！（・∀・）
	自分（＝観察者）が立ってるところはかろうじて夜側（地球の影の中）ですね。
	まさに大気のスクリーンに投影された地球の影を見てることになります。
	これなら屈折も関係ありません。
	（地球が丸いことは必須）

	『低い位置からの太陽光が大気の影響（レイリー散乱）で赤色中心に残り、反対側の大気上層のスクリーンに投影されている』．．．ことは判ります。
	しかし、観察地点からみて地球の影まで見えるという状況が納得いきません。
	太陽光が屈折する可能性を考えたのですが、屈折に関する記述は特に見当たらず。

	ビーナスベルト解説図
	ビーナスベルトのしくみ
	【追記：２０１５／１２／０９】判りにくいという声があるので図を書き足してみました。
	間違ってたら教えて下さい。
	観察できるのは日の出直前・日没直後
	「そしたら、観察できるのは日の出前って事になるんだけどなぁ．．．？」と思ったら、ちゃんと説明に薄明時って書いてありましたよ。
	（白目）
	実際に写真のタイムスタンプみたら夜明け１分前だったので条件に合致します。
	私が観測したのはかなり空が明るいときだったので、自分が夜側にいるという認識が全くありませんでした。
	理解が遅かったのもそのためですね。
	はい．．．すみません。
	ビーナスベルト以外でピンク色に見える空
	空がピンク色をしていても、すべてがビーナスベルトというわけではありません。
	朝焼け・夕焼け（レイリー散乱現象）
	朝焼け・夕焼けの空
	朝焼け・夕焼けによるピンク色の空【ＰＤ】
	これは普通に朝焼けや夕焼けの空。
	一方ビーナスベルトは太陽と反対側に出現します。
	空気全体が染まってるような空（ミー散乱？）
	ピンクに染まる空
	夕立が来そうなときに見られるＲＰＧのエフェクトっぽいピンク空
	また、ビーナスベルトはその名の通り帯状に色が付きます。
	こういう「ＲＰＧで中ボス出てきそうなパターン」は含みません。
	これは「空気中の水分が多すぎて一部ミー散乱している状態」ということになるのかなぁ。
	夕立起こりそうなときによく見る気がします。
	誰か教えてえらい人。
