	ずーっと気になってはいたのだけれど、やっぱりそうでしたか．．．
	「地球の限りある資源で人類が限りなく成長していったら、どうなる？」―それをコンピュータ・モデルでシミューレートし、全世界に衝撃を与えた問題の書『成長の限界（ＬｉｍｉｔｓｔｏＧｒｏｗｔｈ）』が出たのは１９７２年のことです。
	あれから４０年。
	驚くべきことに、ほぼこの予言通りのことが現実に起こっています。
	『成長の限界』は国際シンクタンク「ローマ・クラブ」の委嘱で、マサチューセッツ工科大学（ＭＩＴ）のドネラ・Ｈ．・メドウズ（ＤｏｎｅｌｌａＨ．Ｍｅａｄｏｗｓ）、デニス・Ｌ．・メドウズ（ＤｅｎｎｉｓＬ．Ｍｅａｄｏｗｓ）、ヨルゲン・ランダース（Ｊ？ｒｇｅｎＲａｎｄｅｒｓ）、ウィリアム・Ｗ．・ベーレンズ３世（ＷｉｌｌｉａｍＷ．ＢｅｈｒｅｎｓＩＩＩ）が調査し、まとめた本。

	で、オーストラリアの物理学者グラハム・ターナー（ＧｒａｈａｍＴｕｒｎｅｒ）氏がこのほど、１９７２年のｂｕｓｉｎｅｓｓ−ａｓ−ｕｓｕａｌシナリオの予測値（グラフの破線）と１９７０〜２０００年の実測値（太線）を重ねて、どこまで本当か答え合わせしてみたんですね。
	そしたら
	見ておわかりの通り、人類は２０３０年の終局まっしぐらの道をひたすら突き進んでいたのです。
