	ＢＭＷでは常識ですが．．．コンパクト・セグメントでは初めてのＦＲ（フロントエンジン＋後輪駆動）
	ＢＭＷのクルマは全て、車体前部に縦に置かれたエンジンから生み出されるパワーをリア・ホイールへと伝達させます。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズも例外ではありません。
	後輪駆動方式は伝統的なＢＭＷの特徴であり、魅力的な走り、優れたトラクション、安心できるハンドリングを実現する大事な要素なのです。
	後輪駆動の有効性は、荷物を積むほど高まります。
	前輪を駆動するクルマでは、満載状態になると前車軸への荷重が減少して、トラクションに悪影響を及ぼします。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズならば、このようなことは起こりません。

	そう考えると、ＦＲというのはメリットとデメリットの両面から考えても、高級車に採用されやすい、ということになるわけです。
	トヨタのクラウンや日産のＦＵＧＡ、メルセデス・ベンツの大部分やＢＭＷやジャガーなど、高級車では軒並みＦＲが採用されています。
	そんな中、前回も冒頭で書きましたが、ホンダというのは、ほとんどＦＦ専業メーカーと言ってもよく、最高級セダンであるレジェンドにもＦＦが採用されています。
	ホンダはおそらくＦＦの高級車でも売れると思って出したんだと思いますが、やはりマーケットにはほとんど受け入れられませんでした。
	トヨタのクラウンが毎月数千台規模で売れるのに対し、ホンダのレジェンドは数百台かそれ以下です。
	今後、ＦＲの製造ラインを持たないホンダがレジェンドをどうして行くのか、ちょっと注目したいところです。

	短期の国債金利の購入を増やすことで銀行融資などの金利が下がるため、政府には「企業への融資が加速します。」と言い
	国債買い入れの総額を維持することで、投資家には「国債買い入れは続けますよ。限界じゃないですよ。」と言う
	どっちつかずの金融政策になってしまっています。
	金利ターゲット自体が日銀が「１０年もの国債金利を０．０％とする」と決められるものではなく、市場参加者の取引の結果でしかないため、どこまで狙い通りに金利をコントロールできるのかも不明なのですが

	これ以上マイナス金利になれば、個人が銀行に預ける預金がマイナス金利になったり、海外のように口座管理手数料が発生したり、する可能性もあるのです。
	当然、こうなれば家計への影響は絶大であり、さらに消費を冷え込ませる要因にもなりかねないのです。
	・マイナス金利拡大を日銀が推し進めざるをえない理由
	国債買入れの量的緩和も限界。
	うち手がない
	マイナス金利を導入する前から、物価目標を達成するために、国債を日銀が買い取ることで市場に出回るお金を増やしてインフレ誘導をしてきたのです。
	しかし、円高・株安という流れには抗えずに、結果が全然ついてこないという状況があり、マイナス金利を導入したのです。
	国債を買い取る予算にも限界がありますし、効果もほとんど発揮しないことが証明されてしまったため、国債買入れは続けると明言されているものの、限界に達していることは明らかなのです。
	そのため、マイナス金利拡大も視野に入れているのです。

	日銀の金利ターゲットの住宅ローン金利への影響
	前述したように日銀は
	マイナス金利を推しすすめるためには銀行からの圧力が大きい→マイナス金利が国債金利にも波及し、銀行や保険会社の経営状況が悪化した
	国債買い入れは辞められない→辞めたら投資家に見限られて円高株安になってしまい、アベノミクスが失敗に終わる
	という板挟みの状況に陥っていました。
	そこで９月２０日の金融政策決定会合で「金利ターゲット」という金融政策の導入を決めたのです。

	・マイナス金利は拡大するのか？
	日銀の黒田東彦総裁は４月２８日にマイナス金利政策について「必要があればまだまだいくらでも拡大できる」と話しています。
	確かに日銀のマイナス金利適用は、銀行の預入資産の一部、「基礎残高」「マクロ加算残高」を超えた「政策金利残高」に対してのみとなっています。
	「基礎残高」「マクロ加算残高」「政策金利残高」すべてにマイナス金利を適用することも日銀にはできるのです。

	・英国のＥＵ離脱が起こすユーロ安と他国への影響
	２０１６年６月に英国でＥＵ離脱の国民投票が行われ「離脱」が５２％で勝利をしました。
	英国はＥＵ加盟による移民の受け入れで、自国民の失業率が増え、低所得層に不満が高まってしまったことがこの結果を招いたのです。
	ＥＵに参加していることで、ＥＵ内でのビジネスや人、お金の移動がスムーズになりそれが経済的にプラスになっている側面もありながら、自国の利益が脅かされていると考える人が多いのです。
	実際には、この現象は英国だけではないのです。
	フランスでも、ドイツでも、「ＥＵに多額の予算を払って、他の貧しいＥＵ参加国の面倒を見るのはおかしい。」と考える方がかなりの数いるのです。
	今回の英国国民投票の結果は、他のＥＵ参加国のＥＵ離脱推進派に勢いを与えるものであり、同じような事例が増える可能性があるのです。

	名探偵さんは気づいてるかもしれませんが、僕の苗字「徳谷（とくたに）」と同じ地名なんですよね。
	そもそも、この徳谷姓は日本に約８００人しかいないらしく、同姓に出会ったことは過去一度だけ。
	それも繋がりが一切ないのに「同姓、同学年、関西出身の共通項に惹かれたのでお茶しませんか？」とメールで誘ったときだけなんです。
	徳谷智史さん、超立派な方でした。
	そのあたりから徳谷姓のルーツが気になりだしたんです。
	字面以上に珍しい徳谷姓．．．。
	ずっと大阪在住の父親に尋ねたところ「そんなもんは知らん。お前のおじいちゃんとおばあちゃん共に連れ子同士だから、とっくに血は絶えとるわ」という話をされました。
	とっくに絶えとるんかい。

	↓サロン脱毛が解決↓
	サロン脱毛のメリット
	痛みが少ない。
	または感じない場合が多い
	出力はそれほど高くないので医療脱毛より火傷のリスクが低い
	料金は月額制など様々な支払い方法がある
	サロンなので入るのも恥ずかしくない
	店舗が沢山展開されていて通いやすい
	完了までの期間が早さに関しては医療脱毛にはかないませんが、デメリットを考えると、まずはサロン脱毛に通うことをオススメできます。

	脱毛後は肌が敏感なため色素沈着を起こしやすい状態です。
	紫外線や肌への刺激を避けるようにしましょう。
	脱毛後の日焼け対策ってサロンで絶対説明されるけど、案外忘れがちなんだよね・・・気をつけないと怖いね！

	対策
	信頼のできる実績あるサロンを選択しましょう。
	大手サロンは実績・経験共に豊富のためオススメです。
	また、レーザー脱毛の方が出力が高い機械を使用するため火傷のリスクが高くなります。
	まずは、サロンの光脱毛から始めるのがオススメです。
	安全性が高いと言っても熱を利用した施術なので火傷のリスクがゼロとは言えません。
	このことを頭において、信頼できるサロンを選ぶのがポイントです。

	例えば、通い始めて、耐えられない痛みを感じた場合、まぁいいやで済ませれない金額を支払います。
	こうなると後悔してしまいますよね。
	なので、まずは脱毛がどれくらいの刺激なのか感じるためにも光脱毛から通うのが理想的です。
	サロン脱毛の月額制の場合は、習い事のような感覚で月ごとに一定額の支払いです。
	更に、いつでも辞めることができます。
	なので、一定期間、光脱毛に通っても効果を感じられなかった場合に医療脱毛を検討するのがオススメです。
	しかし、「光脱毛を選択して良かった」と多くの方が効果を実感されています。
	まずは光脱毛をやってみようという気持ちで始めたとしても、きっと満足していただけると思いますよ♪

	自分に似合う髪色がいちばん
	このように世界には色々な髪色の人がいます。
	欧米の人からすると、日本人の髪を染める行為が不思議に映るそうです。
	「どうしてキレイな黒髪をわざわざ金髪や茶髪にするの？」と。
	どうやら、日本人がブロンドヘアーなどに憧れているように、欧米の人も日本人の黒髪を評価してくれているようですね。
	髪を染めればそれだけ髪も傷んでしまいます。
	長く豊かな自毛を保持していくには、若い頃に髪で遊びすぎない必要があります。
	それに、最近は流行りの髪色として、黒髪の良さが見直されていますよね。
	一度明るい髪色にしてしまった人でも「髪色戻したい」という衝動にかられるみたいですね。
	そして黒髪のままオシャレを楽めば、それだけ自毛の健康と美しさを保てますよ。

	こういった理由も加味され准看護師と看護師では職場に違いが出てくるのです。

	これはメーカー（厳密には成分または作り方）と個人の相性という他ありません。
	ビールは飲めない、日本酒は飲めないなど、あるお酒に嫌悪感がある人は他メーカーや他ブランドを飲んでみるのがいいかもしれません。

	「明日野郎は馬鹿野郎！」と自分で自分に喝を入れ、ようやく更新ですっ！！
	「受刑生活で感じたことは？」
	「よくある刑務所の誤解は？」
	「そのときそのときに自分は何を感じていたのか？」
	等々。
	それらを「獄中イノシシ日記」と題し、本日から数日にわたって更新していきます！（予定）
	そんな「獄中イノシシ日記」の記念すべき第一話。
	「刑務所って地元の所にいくんでしょ？」とか「窃盗も殺人も同じ部屋なの？」なんて認識方のもいるかと思うので、まずは「刑務所の種類と分類基準について」を簡単に説明していこうかと。
	※色々な資料を元に調べて書いていますが、もし間違いが分かる方いればご指摘お願いします！！

	極端な例でいうと、「出来心で覚せい剤使っちゃいました．．．」って人と「３人殺してます」っていう人が同じ施設に入ることは無いってこと。
	（男であれば！）
	かくいう自分も逮捕当時はかなりビビッており、「めっちゃ極悪で怖い人ばっかりの部屋に入ったらどうしよぅ〜．．．」なんて思ってましたね（＾＿＾．）

	もはや金では動かない人材．．．．．．建設業界の悲鳴
	「建設業界のクライアントからは、人材不足によってここ２、３年ずっと悲鳴に近い声が聞こえてきています。特に採用難易度の高い施工管理技師などの有資格者は、給料を上げてもなかなか集まりません」
	そう話すのは、大手人材サービス会社で都内の建設業関連企業を中心に担当する営業マンの香月友和さん（仮名）。
	公共工事を直請けする大手・中堅のゼネコンから、下請けで専門工事を行う地場の会社まで４０社程度のクライアントを抱え、求人媒体を利用した採用活動の提案を行っている。

	若年層ではなく中高年層が働き手として求められている
	人材難の大きな要因は、これまで現場の中心であった２０〜３０代の若年層が建設業界の仕事に足を踏み入れることをためらっているからだという。
	「現状の忙しさは皆分かっているし、その要因がオリンピックに向けた大きな流れの中であることも分かっているので、“待遇が安定しているのは今だけ”と考える人が多いようです。確かに資格取得や技能経験を積んでも、５年後に仕事がなくなる可能性があるようでは躊躇してしまいますよね」
	そのため、香月さんが担当するクライアントの中では４０代〜５０代をターゲットに採用活動の方針転換を進めている企業も多いという。
	「２０２０年以降も安定した受注が見込める理由をアピールして、定年まで働きたいと考える中高年を狙っている求人が増えています。また大手ゼネコンでは定年した従業員を再雇用する動きも進んでいます。自社の業務への理解が深く、年齢的に働ける期間は需要がピークとなる向こう数年間だけ。企業と働く人双方にとってメリットがあるやり方だと思いますね」
	新規着工を検討できる潮目の時期は近い？

	「多くの企業が中高年の活用を始めており、採用の難易度も改善されてきています。資格はあるのに雇ってくれる会社がない状況だった施工管理技士など、現場に欠かせない人材を順調に採用できるようになった企業も増えてきました」
	こうした流れが循環していけば、「金はいいから休みが欲しい」という現場の声にも応えていけるようになる。
	「飲食店でパート・アルバイトのシフトを回すように、大人数を抱えて適正な業務量で現場を動かしていくことが可能になれば離職防止にもなります」
	ここ数年来、賃金上昇によって人材募集を続けてきた状況は早期に落ち着くのではないか、と香月氏は予測している。
	「円安による資材高騰も影響もあるので一概には言えませんが、建築費高騰の主要因である人件費については高止まりの気配が見えてきていますね」
	かつての高待遇による一様な採用戦略ではなく、時限的に活用できる中高年の採用で光が見えてきた建設業界の人材難。
	建築費高騰が抑制され、新規物件の着工が検討しやすくなるようになる潮目の時期は意外と近いのかもしれない。
	新築を検討している場合、増税前（建築費は高騰）に動く方が賢いのか、増税後（建築費は抑制）の方が賢いのか．．．．．．しっかり検証し、投資戦略を立てる必要がありそうだ。

	疫病はどの野菜にも発生しますが、実は野菜の科目によって菌の種類が異なっています。
	適切な薬剤を選ぶようにしましょう。
	疫病を防ぐ予防と対策は？
	疫病にかかった抜いた苗は必ず畑の外で処分しましょう。
	畑やプランターの水はけを良くすることが疫病を予防できます。
	過剰な元肥や追肥は避け過繁茂にならないようにしましょう。
	ポリマルチなどで灌水時の泥はねを防止しましょう。
	接ぎ木苗など疫病に抵抗性のある苗を利用することで発病をある程度は防ぶことが出来ます。
	連作や輪作は避けるようにすることで疫病を予防できます。
	収穫後の土中の株は疫病菌の越冬場所となるので必ず除去しましょう。
	疫病を農薬を使わずに治療するには？
	薬剤を使わずに疫病を治療するのは難しいのですが、疫病が発生した株は発症部分を切り取り畑の外に持ち出して処分しましょう。
	その後、発生を抑制する為に土壌と畑の状態を見直し再発を防ぎます。
	疫病が茎に発病した場合は、株ごと処分するか薬剤治療をするしか手立てはありません。
	薬剤を使用したくない方は、疫病になる前に予防と対策をしっかりと行っておくことが大切です。

	遺伝子はどんな働きをするのか？
	それでは、初めに生体内での遺伝子の働き、そして何からできているのか調べていきましょう。
	まず、遺伝子の働きについて説明していきます。
	遺伝子の中には、細胞を作る材料であり、細胞が活動する上で最も重要な働きをするタンパク質を作るための情報が蓄えられています。
	このため、遺伝子の構造や構成が変化すると、生物の構造と機能に変異を生じることになるのです。
	「突然変異」という言葉を聞いたことはありませんか？
	これは、遺伝子の構造が突然変化することによって、通常とは異なるタンパク質できることを意味します。

	つまり、ＤＮＡ配列を解析するということは、ある生物のＤＮＡ上で、どのような塩基配列になっているかを解析しているのです。
	そしてこの塩基配列が持つ意味を遺伝情報といいます。
	遺伝子は、何百万個とＡＴＧＣが並んでいるＤＮＡ上の一部に存在します。
	そのため、我々がどのような遺伝子を持っているのか？という問題を解くためには、まず、ＤＮＡ配列を解析し、ＡＴＧＣがどのような並び方をしているかという情報を得る必要があるのです。
	その後、ＤＮＡ上のどの部分に遺伝子がコードされているのか（情報があるか）ということを発見していかなくてはいけません。
	この「遺伝子って？」の項の最初でいった、遺伝子の構造が変化するというのは、この「ＡＴＧＣ」の並び方が通常と異なってしまう状態のことをいいます。
	「突然変異」などもこの「ＡＴＧＣ」の並び方が異なることで生じる変化のことです。
	このように、ＤＮＡ配列、つまり「ＡＴＧＣ」の並び方によって、生物種としての情報や生命活動が決定されています。
	そのため、「ＤＮＡは生命の青写真」などと表現されることもあります。

	つまり、そこら中にあるわけですから「美味い」は当たり前。
	よく「おれラーメン好きだし、ここより美味いラーメン作れるわ」という安易な動機で開業を目指す人も多いですが、そこら辺にあるような「ただ美味い」だけのお店を出しても来店動機にはなりづらいという事です。
	「じゃぁもう今更ラーメン屋なんてムリじゃんか！」
	と思うのはまだ早い。
	こういった流通しきった市場では「スキマ産業」を狙って行くことでまだまだ繁盛させることが出来ます。
	「こんなお店があったらいいのに」というような不便や不満を解決したスキマ産業で成功した例をいくつか紹介します。

	●第２項分類の方法
	アリストテレスの分類は１８世紀まで使われたが新しい生物の発見があいつぐとこの枠に入りきれないものも多くなった。
	またはじめのうち生物は慣用名でよばれたがちがった生物を同じ慣用名でよんだり分類と関連のない不適当な名前もあって分類学は混乱していた。
	【分類学の父】分類学の父といわれるリンネは『自然の体系』（１７３５年）の中で種の概念を確立し種が生物分類の基本的単位であると述べた。

	種の識別は動物の場合には個体の形態に差があることで行われる。
	雌雄は形態差があっても同種である。
	どの程度の差があると別種とするのかは経験によってなされていることが多く普遍的な原則はない。
	ただし形態差の程度は生殖隔離の差に応じて違っている場合が多いと考えられている。
	繁殖可能な子が生まれるようであれば同種である。
	異なる種を交配して生まれた種は不妊である。
	例えばライオンとジャガーを交配して生まれたライガーには子供ができない。
	したがってライオンとジャガーは別種とする。
	ゲノム分析が可能になってゲノム差が大きく形態差がなくても別種とすべき隠蔽種の発見もある。
	【学名について】種名が国や地域言語によって異なっていては不都合である。
	生物種には世界共通の学名（ｓｃｉｅｎｔｉｆｉｃｎａｍｅ）がつけられている。

	ＭＳシンパな人、Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓが大好きな人は、Ｃ＃を学ぶことが義務付けられている。
	逆にＭＳを敵だと認識している人は、どんなことがあっても使ってはいけない。
	Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓで動くＧＵＩアプリを作りたい場合は、Ｃ＃から始めるのもアリなんじゃないかと思う。

	最近だと話題のＨａｄｏｏｐとかＣａｓｓａｎｄｒａとかがＪａｖａで書かれている。
	その辺りのソフトと親しくなりたい場合は覚えておくと良いかもしれない。
	あとは企業で利用されているケースが目立つので、覚えておけば仕事を得る手助けになる。
	けど、言語としてはだいぶ古いし、なんとか０ｘほどではないにしても新しいバージョンの仕様がなかなか決まらないし（クロージャ入れると言い始めてはや何年？）、モダンなものを求めてしまう人には向かないかもしれない。

	・誰が学ぶべきか
	職場で昔のＰｅｒｌのソースをメンテする必要に迫られるというシチュエーションはけっこうあるので、さらっと読める程度は学んでおいた方が良いかもしれない。
	これから学ぶのであれば、まずどのバージョンを学ぶのかから考える必要がある。
	新しくＰｅｒｌ６（ＲａｋｕｄｏＳｔａｒ）が用意されつつあるけど、Ｐｅｒｌ５と比べるとだいぶ違う言語になっている。
	レガシーなＰｅｒｌを触る必要性を意識して学ぶならＰｅｒｌ５を、新しいＰｅｒｌってどんなものだろうと探究心から学ぶならＰｅｒｌ６を手にとれば良いんじゃないだろうか。

	軽い言語だと勝手に裏側でやってくれるようなメモリの確保とかファイルポインタの操作なんかも、Ｃでは自分で意識して書かないといけない。
	ので、一度触れておくとプログラムが裏側で何をしているかが意識できて良いかもしれない。
	ＯＳや言語の細かい挙動を追いたいという願望が生まれた時に（たとえばＰＨＰのネットワーク関連の機能について、実際にこれは裏では何をしてるんだ、ということが知りたくなった時とか）、Ｃが読めると割とあっさり答えに辿りつけたりもする。
	ガリガリ書けるようになる必要があるかは別として、とりあえず知っておいて損はない言語。

	ＶＢを落としている理由は、今年（２０１１年）はＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔの年になりそうな予兆がちらほら見えることと、ＶＢの説明がＣ＃と若干被る部分があるので（ＭＳの話とか、ＭＳの話とか）、ネタ的な問題もあって入れ替えています。
	一応、これを書いてる人間はＯｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅ−Ｃ以外の９言語は仕事で使ったことがあります。
	Ｊａｖａ、ＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔ、Ｒｕｂｙ、Ｐｙｔｈｏｎはけっこうガリガリ使ってます。
	Ｃ＃、Ｐｅｒｌはさらっとしか使ったことがないのであまり自信はないです。

	・誰が学ぶべきか
	プログラミング言語は、ヘビー級（Ｃ＋＋やＪａｖａ）とライト級（ＰｙｔｈｏｎやＲｕｂｙ）を１つずつ覚えておくと、その場に応じて使い分けられるので何かと便利。
	ライト級の言語を１つも習得してなくてどれにしようか迷っているなら、Ｐｙｔｈｏｎは１つの選択肢になる。
	既にライト級の言語を覚えているなら、無理にＰｙｔｈｏｎに手を出す必要はあまりないかもしれない。

	前書き
	この世にはたくさんのプログラミング言語が存在します。
	Ｗｉｋｉｅｐｄｉａのプログラミング言語一覧を見ると、実に２００個以上というわけの分からない数の言語が並んでいたりします。
	２００の中にはほとんど使われてない言語も混じってるので、実際に仕事でざくざく使われている言語は２０とか３０とかそういうオーダーなのですが、それでも１人の人間が把握するにはちょっと多過ぎる数です。
	本記事では、そうした有り余るプログラミング言語の海の中で「どれを勉強したらいいの？」とか「どれを採用するのが適切？」という悩みをお持ちの方が「よし、この言語に決めた！」と自信を持って決断できるように背中を押すことを目的として書かれました。
	無責任に背中をドンと押すことが目的なので、これを読めば正しい判断ができるかという点についてはノーコメントとさせていただきます。
	使ってみないと過ちには気付けないものさ。

	・誰が学ぶべきか
	初心者がいきなり手を出すのは少し難しいかもしれない。
	まずはＪａｖａかＲｕｂｙに手を出し、その後Ｓｃａｌａにとりかかるのが良いと思われる。
	Ｊａｖａを使っている人は、老若男女問わず今日からでもＳｃａｌａを始めた方がいい。
	Ｒｕｂｙを使っている人の中で、実行速度がもう少し速くならんものかなぁと思っている人は、今日からでもＳｃａｌａを始めた方がいい。
	Ｐｙｔｈｏｎを使っている人は、Ｐｙｔｈｏｎの神様が微妙と言っていたようにちょっと言語の方向性が違うので、興味があるなら使ってみるくらいのスタンスで。

	田んぼ・畑を売却したい！
	一般的に不動産の売買は不動産の引渡しと登記によって完了しますが、農地の場合は購入や売却に際して農業委員会や都道府県知事の許可が必要です。
	売主が農地の購入や売却申請手続きを行い、農業委員会や都道府県知事の許可を得て、始めて売買できることになるのです。
	※許可なしに売買をした場合には契約は無効になります。

	遠田さんに伺うと・・・
	“観賞用の菊を栽培していたときは、もっとずっと穏やかな花で、すぐアブラ虫がついて、その対策に大わらわだったけれど、高橋剛さんのご指導を受け、土にボカシ肥を混ぜて、食用菊「もってのほか」を育てるようになったら、無農薬でも虫も全くつかず、菊が荒々しく咲き誇るようになった”そうです。
	遠田さんの丹精こめた「もってのほか」は、すべて「バランスアルファ」の材料として、完全無農薬・無化学肥料で栽培されており、外側の緑色のガクもいっしょに摘み取られて、そのまま玄米等といっしょに醗酵させます。

	向いてそうで不向きな高リターン狙いの商品
	ついつい「売却益が非課税なので、ＮＩＳＡでは高リターンを狙える商品を買おう」と考えがちだ。
	しかし、高いリターンが望める商品は当然、高リスクで裏目に出れば大きなマイナスになる。
	値下がりに弱いＮＩＳＡ向きとは言いがたい。
	それでも高リスクの株式投資で高リターンを狙いたい投資家もいるだろう。
	その場合、個別株ではなく株式投信の、積み立て投資が選択肢となる。
	売買タイミングを分散することでリスクを下げることができ、ＮＩＳＡ向けの中リスク・中リターン投資に近づけることができるからだ。

	どの食用油でも、基本的には同じことがいえます。
	ただ、油は少量でも高カロリーなので、摂取のし過ぎには注意しましょう。
	また、私たちが普段料理に使っている量も実は摂取のし過ぎということも多いので、自分の食事を一度見直してみるのはいかがでしょうか。

	もっと遊ぶ
	やっぱり、社会人にもなるとゆっくり旅行に行く時間も無くなります。
	海外に行こうと思うと、土日の休みだけでは行けません。
	会社によっては長期休暇もありますが、そういったタイミングは他の人も休みで、どこもごった返しています。
	お盆休みがまさにそれですね。
	大学生であれば、社会人に比べると時間を作りやすいです。
	比較的旅行者が少ないタイミングを見計らって行ってしまうのもありです。
	行ってみたいなという場所があれば、思いっきりバイトしてお金を作って、今しかできない経験をしておきたいですね。
	ゼミの仲間と遊ぶ
	もっとゼミの仲間と遊んだり、活動したりをしておけば良かったなと言っていました。

	なにか実務に役立つようなスキルがあれば派遣社員としては仕事の幅が広がりそうです。
	最近ですとそういった資格を持っているだけで、資格手当がもらえるし、取れそうなものは取っておいて損はないです。
	将来役に立ちそうな資格を
	Ｔさんが言うには、パソコンの資格の他に、登録販売者の資格も取っておきたかったと言っています。
	ドラッグストアで白衣を着て薬をオススメしている人です。
	求人をみてみると、アルバイトだとしても同じお店のレジ係と比べるとすごく優遇されています。
	ただ、これに関してはやっぱり相応の勉強が必要です。
	大学生の時間があるうちに、どんどん資格を取得しておきたいですね。

	ボランティアに参加する
	東北の震災復興へ
	東北の震災があった頃、Ｔさんは大学１年生。
	必須科目が多く、ボランティアに行けなかったことを後悔しています。
	テレビで流れてくる現場の映像を見ながら、ここで勉強していてもイイのかと迷いがあったそうです。
	今の日本社会ではなかなか簡単にボランティアへ参加することができません。
	１日、２日なら行けますが長期間となると難しい。
	そんな動き辛さが今の日本人を縛っているように感じます。
	違う境遇の人と協力する経験
	なぜ、ボランティアをしておきたかったかを尋ねると、Ｔさんからの返答はこうでした。
	「生きた場所、年齢、性別が違う人と力を合わせ、困っている人を助けたり、何かを成し遂げる先に見えるものがある」
	実際、Ｔさんは大学時代も派遣会社で働き、その日合ったばかりの人と仕事をこなしていたそうです。
	そういった経験を通すと、当然、対人能力、さらには一緒に働いたその人の境遇から人生の学びを得ることができ、今後の役に立ちます。
	まとめとコメント
	ＴＡＩＪＩとは違った答えが返ってきて、勉強になりました。
	大学生のうちにしかできないコトはやはりあります。
	時間がある大学時代をどう過ごすかで、それからの人生がガラッと変わってしまう。
	そんな気がしています。
	これ、やっておいた方がイイんじゃない？
	そんな感覚があったら、ぜひ取り組んでみてください。
	取り組まなかった時よりも、１つ成長した人間になっています。

	また、寿司のネタは簡単なのですが、「しゃり」は難しい。
	ご飯の間にシリコンが入り込んでクモの巣状態になってしまい取り出す難易度は最高クラス。

	宅地なら建物を建てる計画、雑種地なら駐車場や資材置き場などの計画が必要とされ、転用許可後は速やかに計画を実行する必要があります。
	そのため、先に転用する場合は、申請した転用目的を一旦は達成しなくてはならなくなり、売買が目的なら先に転用する方法は非効率です。
	もっとも、すぐには売れなくても、耕作もできない事情があるなら、一旦は比較的費用がかからない駐車場に転用して、長期的に売り出す方法は十分考えられます。

	農地の売買について。
	現在の価格相場と売却方法
	都市部を少し離れて田舎に向かうだけで、何も作られていない休耕地や、荒れてしまった耕作放棄地を目にすることは珍しくありません。
	農家の高齢化が問題になってから久しく、後継ぎがいないために農地を売却したい人、農地を相続した結果、農業ができずに不要になっている人が増えていると言います。
	ところが、国民の食料自給の礎となるべき農地は、その保護目的から売却に対し法律で極めて厳しい制限があり、自由に売却することができなくなっています。

	登記については、買主負担となる商習慣から、売主の負担はほとんど発生しませんが、費用負担は売買契約によって定められるので、売主負担になることもあります。
	まとめ
	農地の売買は、農地が持つ重要な役割から、法律で規制されています。
	また、農地以外に転用できるかどうかで、売買価格も買い手も異なります。
	農地転用が可能かどうかを知りたいのであれば、農地区分を農業委員会に確認してみるのが確実でしょう。
	また、売買や転用には農業委員会の許可が必要で、しかも許可されるまでには１ヶ月程度（届出による場合は１０日程度）要するため、手間も時間もかける覚悟は必要です。

	農地の査定について
	後で述べるように、農地を農地のまま売買する場合は、農業関連機関を介して行うか、個人間で売買することが多くなっています。
	不動産会社も上記の通り、手数料が安い上に買い手が限られ、さらに手間も多いとなれば、積極的に取り扱いたい案件ではないでしょう。
	ただ、転用を前提とすれば話は違います。
	農地は一般的に広大であるため、場所によってはそのような広大な土地を探すことも難しく、マンション需要などで求められることがあります。
	（実際、私の実家の近くでは、１年ほど前に遊休農地にマンションが建ちました）
	農地売買に必要な手続きと手数料
	農地売買では、農地として売るか農地以外で売るかによって必要な手続きは異なり、いずれにしても農業委員会から許可を得なくてはなりません。
	どちらも売買の流れとして大きく変わりないですが、許可なくされた売買は無効になることから、通常の不動産売買とは少し流れが違います。

	農地を売却する場合、宅地など農地以外へ転用できる農地と、農地として利用しなくてはならない農地では、買い手も異なり手続きも変わってきます。
	農地の売買で、知っておくべきことをまとめました。
	農地は用途が耕作と決まっており、農家や農業参入者以外は買うことができません。
	ただし、この制限は“農地”であって、“元は農地”なら誰にでも売ることができます。
	つまり、農地を農地以外にしてしまえば、買い手が農家や農業参入者に制限されないということで、農地以外にできるかどうかが１つの分かれ目です。

	農業委員会で不許可になった場合
	売買許可または転用許可は、必ずしも許可されるとは限らないため、農地の売買契約書では、不許可になった場合の条項も定めておきます。
	不許可になった場合は、売買契約が許可を前提としている性質上、当事者からの申し入れがなくても、当然に売買契約が失効して違約金も通常発生しません。
	手付金においても、不許可であればそのまま返還される、いわゆる白紙解除です。
	ただし、不許可を理由としない一方の都合による解約では、一般的な不動産取引と同様に、買主の手付金放棄または売主の手付金倍返しになります。

	２つ目は、「以前、作成した完成されたアクセスのプログラムを「テンプレート（ひな型）」として使うことです。」
	中途半端な、動かないプログラムではダメですよ。
	データベースの設計（項目の作成）は、新しいシステムに合わせて作成してゆきますが、テーブルやクエリをコピーして修正することもあります。
	テーブルとクエリの作成は、あまり手間はかかりませんので、最初から作成しても問題はありません。
	でも、フォームの作成は最初から作成するのは大変です。

	それでサービス内容に不満があったり、もっといろいろなサービスを使ってみたくなったら、その時に年会費のかかるカードに切り替えればＯＫです（下記記事も参考に）。
	２．カード発行会社で選ぶ：
	次におすすめなのが、クレジットカードの発行会社でどのカードを選ぶかを決めること。
	日本だけでも１００社以上のカード会社がクレジットカードを発行しているので、どの会社を選ぶかだけでもクレジットカードの比較が出来ます。
	大手カード会社がやはりいいのか？
	ではどのクレジットカード発行会社が良いのかというと、これはみなさん次第。
	基本的には大手クレジットカード会社であろうが中小クレジットカード会社であろうが買い物における使い勝手には違いはないのですが、やはりセキュリティ面での安全を重視するとか、万が一の時のサポート体制が気になるという方は大手を選ぶほうが無難です。

	前述のように万が一の時の対応にも安心できるはずですよ。
	３．ポイント還元率で比較：
	３つ目はポイント還元率で選ぶ方法です。
	とにかくクレジットカードを買い物で使ってポイントを貯めたい．．．という方におすすめの比較方法ですね（ポイント還元率とは何？という方は下記記事参照）。
	１ポイントの価値がわかれば、クレジットカードのお得さが即座にわかる！ポイント還元率の計算方法をこの機会に覚えよう。
	但し、ひとことにポイント還元率が高い、低いといっても年会費が別途かかるのではそれもしっかりと考慮しないといけません。

	巷ではＥＱやコンプの使い方に始まり、エキサイターやプラグインを使った様々な「魔法」が取り沙汰されることが多いですが、
	本記事では初心に帰って「バンドサウンドをつくるとき、どの楽器をどの辺に置けば良いんだろう？」というステレオのＬＲチャネルの配置の仕方、つまりパンの置き方について、持論を書いてみようかと思います。

	ギターのパンの振り方
	はい、ギターなんですが、ステージ上は「上手（かみて）」「下手（しもて）」という風にツインギターで分かれるのが基本です。
	で、ボーカルギターだったり、ギターが一人だったりするパターンも、もちろんあります。
	では、ＣＤなどの音源に収録する場合はギターはどうすれば良いのか？という話ですが、上記のパターンを無視して左右に振るのが安定です。
	具体的には、以下のような例が良いと思います。

	外国で言語を教えたり、営業で飛び回ったりなど、仕事のなかには、旅の要素がもとから組み込まれているものもあります。
	逆に、趣味の旅行をしながら、いくばくかのお金を稼ぐ方法もあります。
	大金とはいきませんが、ちょっと贅沢な夕食代や博物館の入場料を稼ぐことぐらいなら十分に可能です。

	ＴＶ番組『ダウンタウンのガキの使いやあらへんで！！』内の企画で人気の高い「笑ってはいけない」シリーズ。
	何があっても絶対に「笑ってはいけない」というルールで、出演者は収録に挑みます。
	もし、笑ってしまった場合はその場で罰を受けます。
	「笑ってはいけない」という緊張感がまた、笑いを誘発するのです。
	そんな同企画の仕込みかと思うような広告が、年始早々にＳＮＳを中心に話題となりました。
	その広告とは、小林製薬の鼻うがい製品「ハナノア」。
	鼻うがいとは、鼻の穴からダイレクトに洗浄液を注入するうがいの方法で、これが花粉症などにも効果がみられるのです。
	専用の洗浄液を鼻に入れて流すことで、鼻の奥に入った花粉、ハウスダスト、雑菌などをまるごと洗い流す同製品。
	花粉の時期に「鼻をとってまるごと洗いたい」と思う方には、もってこいの花粉対策といえるでしょう。

	君島達己社長は２月１日に開いた経営方針説明会で、マリオランに言及。
	それまで任天堂のゲームを販売していなかった地域でもプレーされていることに触れ、「全世界の幅広い皆様にお届けすることができた」とＩＰの広がりを強調した。
	収益面はどうか。
	スマホゲームの主流は、基本プレーを無料にしてアイテム課金で収益を稼ぐモデルだ。
	一方、マリオランは一部無料で１２００円を支払えば全編遊べる「買い切り方式」を採用し、注目されていた。

	道具のことを書いてしまいましたが一番重要なのはやはり毎日の練習です。
	日々の練習ではロングトーンの他に音階・半音階・アルペジオを混ぜてやると良いでしょう。
	なにか一つ決まった教本を使うといいですね。
	後で記ますね。
	先ほどもいったように何を吹くときでも必ず息の流れに注意して下さい。
	また、演奏会など生のいい音を聴くこと、ＣＤを聴きまくることです。
	自分が出したい音のイメージを持つことがとても大事です。
	ただなんとなく漠然と楽器を吹くのではなく、必ず音に対するイメージを持って、そして息の流れを意識しながら吹く！意識して意識して意識して吹いていって・・・終いには無意識にできればもう最高！こういう習慣ができるといいですね。
	まずは意識をすること。
	必ず上手くなりますよ。
	漠然と吹いているのと注意しながら吹くのでは、まったく違う結果が現れてくるから。
	あなどるなかれ！毎日の積み重ねが大事って事だね。
	以上のお答えは、ＴＷＷサックス奏者：松原孝政氏からいただきました。

	以上のお答えは、吉田隆一氏からいただきました。
	バリトンサックスに限らず、他の管楽器にも言えることですが、まず第一に「息がしっかり楽器に入っているかな？」ということです。
	まずｆｆでロングトーンをすることが手っ取り早いでしょう。
	とにかく沢山息を吸って、出来るだけ音を長くのばしてみてください。
	このとき音が震えないようにね！沢山息をとって、沢山吹く。
	単純ですがコレなんです。
	楽器（道具）の事から云えば、自分に合ったリードを見つける事です。
	特にサックスの場合はリードという厄介なものと仲良くなることが必要不可欠ですね。
	リードを選ぶ時には必ず、速い息を使って音を出して下さい。
	ちなみに速い息というのは、まず右手を開いて、指は閉じ、口から約５ｃｍ前に、そう！「オホホッ」いう感じで！そこで息を右手に吹きかける。
	こうやって確認してみて下さい。
	この時、温度を感じてくださいね。
	冷たければ○、暖かければ×。
	冷たい息＝速い息ということになりますね。

	例えばパーカッションの人たちがやる「基礎打ち」の感覚で、４分→８分→３連→１６分と言った感じでメトロノームに合わせて最低音をタンギングしてみましょう。
	音量は極力落としてみます。
	最初はメトロノームを６０くらいに合わせて、徐々に早めてみましょう。
	目標は１２０！（この早さで１６分をシングルタンギングで出来たら相当な技術です）最低音からＧの音くらいまで、それを何度も繰り返してみましょう。
	小さな音でやることによって、少しずつ低音域のコントロールも身に付いてくるので一石二鳥です。

	※思いこみを認識する作業は、心の痛みを伴う場合があります。
	つらい過去を蒸し返すこともあるかもしれません。
	それでも痛みを直視し、客観的に分析する勇気をもたなければ、自分を苦しめている思いこみは明らかになりません。
	紙やパソコンに書きましょう。
	（書くと認識しやすくなります）
	そして、自分がピンときて納得できるまで根気よく、くりかえましょう。
	思いこみが特定できれば、悩みの半分以上を解決したも同然です。
	それでは次に紹介する５つの方法で、悩みを「無効化」していきましょう。

	思いこみを壊すには、反対の証拠や例をあげていくのが効果的です。
	先の例で、「私はバカだ」という思いこみの反対の例をあげいきます。
	「私は、一生で一度も、バカだといわれたことがない」
	「私の仕事ぶりは、沢山の人に評価されている。だからバカではない」
	とりあえず、質よりも量が大事です。
	頭のなかで考えるだけでなく、どんどん紙やパソコンに理詰めで書いていきましょう。

	なお、中にはペニシリンに対してアレルギーを有している患者さんがいます。
	この場合はペニシリンアレルギーを防ぐため、ペニシリン系抗生物質を他の抗菌薬に変えて投与しなければいけません。
	どうしてもペニシリン系抗生物質を使用したい場合、少量から投与して徐々に投与量を増やすことで慣れさせていきます。
	これを脱感作といいます。
	脱感作をすれば、ペニシリン系抗生物質を投与しても問題ありません。
	ペニシリン系抗生物質の作用機序
	細菌とヒトの細胞を比べたとき、細菌には細胞壁があるものの、ヒトの細胞には細胞壁がありません。
	そこで、ペニシリン系抗生物質では、細胞壁の合成を阻害することでその作用を発揮します。
	細胞壁がなければ、細菌の細胞内に水が流入してくるようになります。
	その結果、細胞が膨張して破裂し、死滅していきます。
	そのため、ペニシリン系抗生物質は殺菌性抗菌薬に分類されます。

	●「人口減少で経済ゼロ成長」はあまりにも悲観的すぎないか？
	このように、人口減少が日本にとって大問題であることは間違いありません。
	そして人口減少問題が意識されてからの数十年間、とりわけ経済については、人口減少によって今後は右肩下がり、よくてゼロ成長だろうという悲観論が、半ば常識的に語られてきました。
	しかし、私はこうした見方に異議を唱えています。
	人口減少を悲観的にしか語らない人は、経済成長というものについて、人々がツルハシを持って道路工事をするイメージしか持ち合わせていないからです。
	経済の供給サイドについて言えば、よく語られるのはこういうことです。
	労働力人口の減少によって、１００人で工事をしていた工事現場の労働者が１０人に減ると、アウトプットは９０人分減ってしまう。
	それが国全体で起きれば、日本はマイナス成長になる――。

	マルチのマフラーにワインのコートを合わせた着こなし画像
	ただの赤とは違う、ワインのダッフルコートはグッと大人の魅力が高まる１着。
	丈が短いので脚長に見える効果もあります。
	ボタンを閉じてもすっきりして見えますが、写真では前を開けて、アクセントとなるマルチカラーのマフラーを見せています。
	これにより、トップスがホワイトのカットソーでも地味に見えません。
	上半身がカラフルな分、下半身はブラックのタイトなカーゴパンツとバブーシュシューズで、全体のバランスを上手くとっています。

	キレカジファッションは若者だけ？
	２０代を中心に流行っているキレカジファッションですが、若い年代の人だけができる
	ファッションというわけではありません。
	色やデザイン、サイズなど自分にあったアイテム
	を組み合わせれば、３０代、４０代以上でも十分にチャレンジできるファッションです。
	特に中年以降の男性は休日のカジュアルファッションが苦手と言う人も多いですが、
	キレカジのポイントさえ押さえていれば、清潔感溢れるコーディネートができます。
	しかも無理な若づくりをせず、オシャレで若々しい自分を演出することもできます。

	ちなみに、多くの女性にしてみれば、
	バリトンボイスが一番聞き心地がイイ・・・とどこかで聞いたことがある。

	まとめ
	今回は声種に関するお話でしたが、いかがでしたか？
	今回ご説明した内容は、必ずこう定義されている！！というわけではないので、
	軽い気持ちで参考にしていただけたら幸いです。
	あなたはどんな声種ですか？？
	日本人って、普段はけっこう不自然な声で喋っていたりするので、
	本当の自分の声が何なのか、まだ分からない方も多いと思います。
	リラックスして正しい発声法で発する素の声こそ、あなたの本当の声♪
	一回それを見つけてみてはいかがでしょうか？
	今日は、ここまでにしたいと思います。
	長くなりましたが、ここまで読んでくださりありがとうございます！☆

	バス
	女声のアルトと同じく、日本人では希少である。
	これも細分化されないと思う。
	バスバリトンと比べても声域はほぼ変わらないが、
	より深く厚く、地を這ってくるような感じがする。
	王様や悪魔など、偉大なる役柄を演じる上で適しているかもしれない。
	バス歌手には体もデカい人が多く、舞台映えも半端ない気がする。
	少し古い人でイギリスのバロック声楽家ＤａｖｉｄＴｈｏｍａｓ（アメリカの歌手とは別人）がいるが、
	彼はバス歌手の割に威圧感がなく、私としては割と好きな声だ。
	その他の声種
	以上では、６つの声種を細分化して分類してみました。
	細分化の仕方や、それぞれの明確な定義はけっこう曖昧だったりしますが、
	まあ、だいたいこんな感じです！
	ってことで、参考にしてみてください♪
	では、最後に、特種なものを・・・。
	・カウンターテナー
	・カストラート
	このふたつです。
	では、説明していきましょう！

	？大学に進んだ同級生と遊んでしまった。
	これも浪人生によくある失敗例です。
	大学生からの誘いをすべて断ることもひとつの方法です。
	？さすがに、すべて断るのは今後のことも考えるとやりづらいという場合には、食事（ラーメン、焼肉等）やカフェ限定にすることがおすすめです。
	食事やカフェは長くて１時間、ラーメンなら３０分程度で終わります。
	そもそも１人であっても食事時間は取りますのであまり無駄がありません。
	食事の後のカラオケ、オンラインダーツ、ゲームセンターなどの誘いは全て断ります。
	これを春休みから一度の例外もなく徹底すれば、友人も食事にだけ誘うようになります。
	また大学に居場所ができると誘う回数も自然に減っていきます。

	？【２】朝の儀式を外さないこと
	１日を２５時間と認識している体内時計を起床後にリセットすることが必要になります。
	効果的なリセットを行うにはカーテンを開けて太陽の光を浴びることと朝食を取ることが必須です（胃腸が弱い方は朝食は少なめでも構いませんが、一般にはある程度の分量があったほうがリセット効果は高いとされます）。
	可能であれば２０分以上の散歩をするとより効果的です。
	？【３】朝の行き場を作ること
	予備校の本科生にならない場合、たとえば朝食をファストフード店で取り１時間程度の勉強をしてくる習慣をつける、朝９時に図書館に入るなど、朝の行き場を作ることが非常に大切です。
	自宅学習デーであっても、午前中は外出したほうがペースをつかめます。
	もし友人に同級生がいれば、図書館などで待ち合わせをすることも有効です（ただし、あまりに目標が低い友人の場合は逆効果になります）。

	？大学受験において英語の配点が高いのは、今後のグローバル社会に合わせてという理由ではありません。
	英語の点数が高いことが、中１から高３にかけて一度もサボらなかったことの証明になるからという要素があります。
	逆に言えば、中３高１までさかのぼって英語の勉強を計画的に行えば、伸ばすことは不可能ではありません。
	英語の苦手な浪人生が失敗するのは、初めから大学受験レベルの問題集に取り組むからです。
	失敗例３授業を受けるだけで、伸びなかった
	小学生
	？中高一貫校出身の生徒は関係ありませんが、高校受験を経験した生徒は「もう一度同じことをすれば良いんでしょ？」と１年を過ごし失敗することがあります。
	特に中３のときに塾に通っていた生徒ほど失敗しやすくなります。
	？その理由は高校受験塾がやや過保護すぎることにあります。
	高校には中学生のほぼ全員が進むため、勉強下手な生徒も多くいます。
	そのため塾側が授業、宿題、問題集、自習室の管理を通じて、塾に来るだけである程度得点できるシステムを作り上げています。
	高校受験塾経験者（特に成功組やあまり深く考えずに受験した生徒）は、「もう一度同じことをすれば良いんでしょ？」と予備校や塾の授業を受けることで満足してしまい成績が伸びないことが良くあります。

	その分初心者には育てやすいのですが、他の植物を枯らしてしまうため注意が必要です。
	しかし私達が爽快な清涼感を感じる香り元、ペパーミントの主成分のメントールは冷却作用や鎮痛作用があることから冒頭でもお話ししたように様々な用途があるため私達の生活に役立つハーブの一つです。
	ミントの生育適温と好適環境
	ミントの生育適温は１５〜２５°Ｃです。
	冬は地上部は枯れてしまいますが根は生きていますので翌春また出てきます。
	冬に収穫したい場合は１０°Ｃ以上を維持した室内で管理すれば収穫することができます。
	好適環境は日当たりがよく風通しの良い場所で育てましょう。
	極端な乾燥に弱いので乾燥させすぎには注意です。
	タネと苗から栽培
	ミントはタネからも育てられますが初心者なら苗から栽培を始めた方がより簡単なので今回は苗からの栽培方法で進めていきます。

	２−２．ＬＩＮＥなどコミュニケーションできるアプリで代替
	そもそも迷惑メールが届くのは、メールアドレスがオフィシャルなものであり、アドレスさえ合致していれば、他人でも送信や受信ができてしまうからです。
	家族や友人とメッセージをやりとりするのなら、お互いが認可しあっていなければ通信できない、ＬＩＮＥ、カカオトーク、Ｓｋｙｐｅなどのコミュニケーションツールを使う手があります。
	また、Ｆａｃｅｂｏｏｋユーザー同士が通信できるメッセンジャーや、海外ではユーザーが非常に多いＷｈａｔｓＡｐｐも頼りになります。
	さらに、電話番号同士でメールをやりとりできるＳＭＳという選択肢もあります。

	もっとも強力な方法です。
	後述しますが、世界中の悪徳業者がいろいろな手段を用いてメールアドレスを収集しており、本人がいくら気をつけても知人の電話帳から自分のメールアドレスが流出する可能性があります。
	つまり時間が経つほどそのアドレスは迷惑メールの標的になりやすくなるため、変更することで完全なリセットが可能です。
	もちろん新しいアドレスを知人に通知する必要がありますが、その際に知人が指定したアドレスのみを受信する設定だった場合、メール以外の手段でアドレス変更を知らせなければいけません。
	２．【間接的対処】ｉＰｈｏｎｅへの迷惑メールの影響を減らす方法
	２−１．無料メールを活用し、キャリアメールの使用を限定する
	携帯キャリアのメールアドレス変更は少々手間ですよね。
	またスマホは基本的にメール着信がユーザーに通知されるため、メールの開封率がパソコンのメールにくらべ高い傾向にあります。
	だからこそ悪徳業者にとって、携帯キャリアのメールアドレスは美味しいターゲットなのです。
	であれば、携帯キャリアのアドレスをあえて使わず、無料で取得できるＧｍａｉｌ、Ｙａｈｏｏ！メールなどを、携帯メールがわりに使うという手があります。
	≪無料メールを使う４つのメリット≫

	そして営利目的とはいっても、通常の方法で売り込むことのできない怪しげなものを大量に拡散しているのが迷惑メールですから、上記のような怪しいメールを受信してしまっても、興味を持たずすぐに破棄すれば問題は起きません。
	言い替えれば、本文を読み、興味を持ってしまう人がいるかぎり、迷惑メールはなくなりません。
	また迷惑メールの送信は、ゾンビパソコンと呼ばれる犯罪者に秘密裏に操られているグループ化されたパソコンにより、常時送信されています。
	１分間で１０００通以上、１日に１００万通以上の迷惑メール送信を行うゾンビパソコンのグループも確認されています。
	犯罪者にとっては、コストがほぼかからず、送れば送るほど利益になるのですから、迷惑メール送信が完全になくなることは当面ないでしょう。
	３−２．メールアドレスは収集され、販売されている
	それでは迷惑メールを大量に送信する犯罪者は、送信先をどのように確保しているのでしょうか。

	チェック３．感染症や病気にかかっていませんか？
	インフルエンザのような感染症にかかると、つらい倦怠感に悩まされることがありますが、いわゆる鼻風邪症状を引き起こす副鼻腔炎が原因で身体がだるくなることも。
	そのほか、貧血や糖尿病、甲状腺機能低下症など、倦怠感はさまざまな病気とつながっている可能性もあり、決して軽くみてはいけません。

	スーツの素材について
	スーツでよく使われる素材についてです。
	カジュアルだと素材より見た目重視の方が多いでしょうが、スーツでは生地自体にもこだわって欲しいです。
	スーツは休日以外ほぼ毎日着るとなると私服よりもずっと着用時間は長くなります。
	そうなるとスーツへのダメージも増えていき、着こなしの大敵であるシワや、着用感の低下から印象も変わってきてしまいます。
	そのため各素材の特徴を知り自分に合った素材を選び、それらをなるべく防ぐことが日々の正しい着こなしにも繋がってくるのです。

	またシワになっても２、３日ハンガーにかけておくとほとんどシワが取れるので３着ほどをローテーションして着るようにするのがオススメです。
	予算が限られている方や出張が多い方はポリ混でできるだけウール１００％に近い見た目の生地にしましょう。
	見た目の判別のみで問題ないですが、基本的にウールの比率が多いとウール寄りの機能と見た目に、ポリエステルが多いとポリエステルよりの機能と見た目になります。
	まとめ
	まとめると、
	チャコールグレーの無地かピンストライプ
	ミディアムグレーの無地かピンストライプ
	ダークネイビーのピンストライプ
	で、ウール１００％の生地
	を、３着程度ローテーションが理想となります。
	もしスーツを１着もお持ちでない方はこのまま、何着かお持ちの方は買い足す際の参考にしていただければオーケーです。
	知識的な内容が多くなってしまったので、全て覚えずともポイントだけつかんで実践していただけたら幸いです。

	※両親以外や会社の上司を祝う場合は？
	昔は６０歳で引退される方が多かったようですが、今はまだまだ現役
	なんて方も沢山いらしゃいるので、そんな方へ感謝を込めて還暦祝いをされることも多いですよね。
	お祝いのされ方は様々ですが、慰安旅行中にプレゼントしたり、内緒にしていて職場で誕生日に渡したりして、ちょっとサプライズな演出をされるなど渡す側も楽しまれてはいかがでしょうか？

	そうそう、あとはお祝いする方が集まりやすい時！
	お正月やゴールデンウイーク、お盆休みなどご家族が揃われるタイミングにお祝いをされる方も多いですね。
	６０才で定年退職される方も多いので、ご勇退記念を兼ねてされる方もおられます。
	「還暦のお祝いにしようか、退職のお祝いにしようか悩んでるんです」ってご相談されることもあります。
	ご一緒にお祝いされる方は定年退職前にお祝いをされるなら還暦の祝い、定年退職直後にされるなら退職のお祝いにされたりしても良いかもしれませんね。
	色々なことを書きましたが、形にとらわれずお祝いしたいという気持ちが一番大切かと思います。
	６０歳の誕生日がある年で、参加者やもちろんご本人の都合が良い時にされればいいと思います。
	現在の６０歳の方はまだまだお若いです。
	６０歳の年を過ぎた場合でも、お誕生日やご家族が集まった際に６０歳の時にはできなかったけど、感謝の気持ちを届ける機会を設けるのも良いのではないでしょうか。
	形ではなくその気持ちが一番のプレゼントかと思います。

	（４）要旨の作り方〜重要な内容を３つ程度でまとめる
	先に述べた通り、要旨は文章を作って、その内容を要約し、最後に作るべきものです。
	報告書に「内容要旨」が必要な理由は、読み手がそこを見て、すぐに報告書の「結果」（結論）が理解できるためです。
	報告書を読むのは、自分より立場が上で、忙しく、報告書の文書などで余計な時間を取りたくないと考えている方です。
	報告書の「内容要旨」は重要なことを３つ程度書く。
	分量としては３行程度（５０字程度）
	〜人が一度に理解しやすい分量はこれぐらい。
	報告相手（上司）の知りたいことを書くよう心がける。

	２−４．報告書作成のポイント
	〜報告書が完成すれば「声に出してチェックする」
	報告書を提出する際、口頭で内容を求められる事が多々あります。
	ですから、報告書の内容・枚数にかかわらず、一言（１５秒、５０文字）、１分（２００字程度）で内容を声に出して説明できるか確認すべきです。
	２−５．報告書作成のポイント
	〜全体的な「見栄え」に注意する
	忙しい上司や顧客は、報告書を読むに値するかどうかを、資料の「ぱっと見の美しさ」からまず判断します。
	見栄えにも配慮があれば、内容もよく吟味され、確かだと見なされます。

	３．報告書の具体的な書き方
	（１）標題
	文書の概要が一目で伝わるように１５〜２０字で具体的に書きます。
	△「出張報告」
	△「安心メディカルへの出張の件」
	○「安心メディカル本社への「とるとる」販売に関する出張報告」
	日付、具体的な報告内容を標題に込めると内容を理解しやすくなります（よって、中身を詳しく読んでくれる事となります）。
	（２）本文
	簡潔に「標題（掲題）の件につき、下記の通り、ご報告いたします」と書きます。
	その後で、文書の場合は「記」と真ん中に記して、箇条書きで各項目を続ける（メールの場合は「記」を省略する）。
	最後は「以上」で締める。
	（３）状況説明
	状況説明は項目分けして箇条書きにして書きます。
	将来、万一、将来、トラブルが発生した場合には重要な証拠にもなりますので、あくまで正確に書いてください。

	〜ここがヌケていると甘い仕事とみなされます
	１こんな内容なら、上司はここを読むだけで内容が分かり、次の対応の判断を下すことが可能。
	もし、簡潔な報告書を求められたら、ここまでの内容で十分に報告書になります。
	２重要なのは、結果を報告するだけではなく、次に「どのようなアクションをするか」ということを報告書に盛り込むことです。
	【提出を受ける側から見た報告書のポイント】
	報告書を読んだ後、上司が次の行動にいち早く、そして確実に移るために必要な事柄が求められる。
	・「報告書は早く欲しい」
	・「課題は何か？を明確に書いて欲しい」
	〜相当に「業務を知る」事がないと、課題は書けない。
	文書は「仕事を写す鏡」
	報告書作成のポイントを学べる研修はこちら
	【公開講座】報告書・議事録の書き方研修
	４．報告書の詳細な内容のポイント
	「詳細内容（ヒアリング事項等）」は、報告の「内容要旨」の部分を受けて、さらに詳細な内容を説明する所です。
	本文の形式
	「見出し」→「小見出し」→「説明文」の３つの階層をつけて書くとわかりやすい。
	○３つの関係
	「見出し」の説明が「小見出し」
	「小見出し」の詳細が「説明文」
	●逆に見れば
	「説明文」の要約が「小見出し」
	「小見出し」の要約が「見出し」
	〜ビジネス文書全体がこの形になっている。

	【注意点】
	・（株）（略称の使用は不可、株式会社と書くべき、また、通称ではなく、フルネームで書くべき）
	・名前の間違い（漢字間違い、旧漢字が正しいなど）
	・役職間違い（本来部長なのに課長とするなど）
	報告書作成のポイントを学べる研修はこちら
	【公開講座】報告書・議事録の書き方研修
	２−２．報告書作成のポイント
	〜文字量に着目する
	文字量に留意しながら報告書を作成すると、目的にあった上手な報告書が書けます。
	・一言で報告する場合＝５０字（＝１２〜１３秒）にまとめる
	・簡潔に１分で報告する場合＝２００字
	・一般的な報告書を作る（要旨＋詳細内容）＝Ａ４用紙１枚で要旨、２枚〜３枚で詳細内容
	２−３．報告書作成のポイント
	〜文書表現の注意点
	●「ですます調」と「である調」の混同をしない
	一気に文書を書き上げた場合には、特に見直しが必要です。
	必ず読み直して、チェックしましょう。
	●助詞の重複を避ける
	同じ助詞が３回以上連続すると読みにくくなります。
	そのような場合は文章を分割する等、構成や表現を変えましょう。
	●句読点の打ち方

	足の長さや、実体（本体）の色、大きさで呼び名も、線の性質も違うことが分かります。
	＜基礎編＞
	＜応用編＞
	※代表的なローソク足を紹介していますが、この見方が絶対的に正しいというものではありません。
	これらの線は安値圏で出るか、中値で出るか、高値圏で出るかによって大きく意味は異なってきます。
	過去の値動きを基に統計的に、そうなりやすいという一つの考え方としてご活用ください。

	５まとめ
	いかがでしたか。
	株価は市場が提供するとても重要な情報ですが、よりよく活用するにはもう少し踏み込んで理解する必要があります。
	そのためには次の３つをしっかり押さえておきましょう。
	●会社の株主の価値の合計である株式時価総額を理解する
	●株価の高・低と、株価が割高・割安であることは別にして考える
	●株価の割高・割安は、以下の２面からチェックする
	？過去の株価の水準と比べて現在の株価の位置はどこにあるのか、という考え方で割高・割安を判断する
	？株価収益率（ＰＥＲ）や株価純資産倍率（ＰＢＲ）を手掛かりに、株価が割高か割安かを考える。
	特に、同業他社との比較は重要。
	上記の３点を頭に入れた上で、新聞やインターネットの株式欄をチェックする習慣をつけてください。
	株式欄をチェックする際のおすすめは、新高値・新安値の銘柄をフォローすることです。
	市場の評価を上げている銘柄、あるいは下げている銘柄を定期的に見ることで、さまざまな株価の動きをより深く理解できるようになります。
	株価チャートとは？
	チャートとは１日、１週間、１ヶ月といった期間の株価をグラフ化して見やすくしたものです。
	ただ、株価を見ただけでは、安いか、高いかを判断できません。
	そんなときに参考として用いられます。
	また、相場のトレンドや過熱状態等を捉えるために活用することもできます。

	この場合は「パソコンが入力を求めていたことについて、私たちが気付かなかったこと」が動かなくなった原因ということになります。
	つまり、パソコンの「入力待機」が原因です。
	２−１−２．マウスポインターの動作確認
	画面内に特別な表示が見あたらない場合、パソコンが本当に止まってしまっていることがあります。
	マウスを動かして「マウスポインター（マウスに連動する画面内の矢印）」が動くかどうかを確認してください。
	マウスポインターが動作しない場合、何らかのトラブルが原因です。
	また、同じようにキーボードの動作も確認してましょう。
	Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓパソコンであれば「Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓキー」を押して、スタートメニューまたは、スタート画面が表示がされるかを確認してください。
	Ｍａｃの場合には、「Ｃｏｍｍａｎｄ」キーを押しながら「Ｔａｂ」キーを押してみて、ウィンドウ画面が切り替わるかを確認します。
	マウスが動作しないのにキーボードでは操作できる場合は、パソコンではなくマウスのトラブルです。
	これにはいくつかの対処方法があります。
