	語源とする説もいろいろとあるようですが、日本古来の音楽であります、「雅楽（ががく）」の中の一曲に、「千秋楽」という特別な曲があるそうです。
	こちらの楽曲が、必ず最後の曲として演奏されていた事にちなんで、最後日にかけて、「千秋楽」と呼び出したようです。
	また、呼び方を省略して「楽日（らくび）」と言ったり、最終日の先日のことを、「前楽（まえらく）」と言ったりもするそうです。
	「千秋」が略されているのですね。
	ちなみに「千穐楽」と記述する場合も多いようですが、これは「秋」の字に「火」が入っている為、その昔、火事の多かった繁華街では、火事を連想する「火」を意味嫌い「穐」と記述していたのだそうです。
	言葉一つにもいろいろなルーツがあって、調べてみると面白いものですね。

	現代の専門家によれば、この大気汚染による死者は１万２千人。
	イギリスならではの日常的な悪天候から、注意を払った地元民は当初、ほとんどいませんでした。
	ところが空が次第に黄色がかり、腐った卵のような臭いが漂い始めたのが同日の午後。
	翌日も視界の悪さに加えて、ゴミのような悪臭は５日間続きました。
	息もしがたく、同年１２月９日には１５万人もの人々が入院していたといいます。

	それによるとロンドンスモッグの悪臭や空の色の異常、人体への影響を引き起こしたのは、硫酸塩とよばれる硫酸の粒子。
	研究チームは自然発生した霧の状況下、硫酸塩が水滴のなかで二酸化硫黄と二酸化窒素の化学相互作用によって形成されたことを証明しました。
	またこうした硫黄や窒素は、石炭を燃やした煙突や、僅かながら自動車から排出されたと考えられています。
	そして、硫酸塩は硝酸塩や有機物などの粒子が形成するのを促進し、霧の状態をさらに悪化させました。
	その後、霧に含まれる水分が乾くと、霧の中に含まれていた酸が濃縮され、有害物質を生み出し、それは人の肺など触れたものすべてを覆い尽くしたのです。
	同様の化学反応は、北京や西安の霧がかった空にも確認されました。
	これらの都市ではアンモニアのような農薬が原因だと考えられています。
	気候や化学的な条件はさまざまにあるものの、今回の研究でロンドンスモッグのような状況は、理論上、世界中で発生する可能性があると示されています。

	のしあわびの「のし」は“延ばす、延びる”に通じ、古来中国で鮑は不老長寿の薬効があるとされていたことから、寿命を延ばすおめでたいものの象徴とされ、祝儀、お祝い事の贈り物などに添えて用いられました。
	のちに、熨斗鮑の代わりに、昆布や紙を使うようになりました。
	現代では、のし袋やのし紙などに右イラストのように用いられています。
	のし袋やのし紙の表書きは、毛筆、又は筆ペンを使ってバランス良く丁寧に。
	また、市販されている祝儀・不祝儀袋のなかには、間違った形のものもあります。
	こういったものを選ばない様、気を付けましょう。

	製造コスト面では不利なＦＲ
	運転の楽しさを実現するという点で有利なＦＲですが、逆に製造コストは高くなり、エンジンの生む駆動力を後輪に伝えるために必要になるドライブシャフトが車体中央の床下を貫通するため室内空間が狭くなるといったデメリットもあります。
	このようなことから少しでも製造コストを下げ、より広い室内空間を確保するという最近のクルマ作りには合わず、多少の走りを犠牲にしてもフロント・エンジン＋前輪駆動という「ＦＦ」が国内外の多くのモデルで採用されています。

	例えばＲＵＰにおいては、ただやみくもにサイクルを実行するのではなく、各サイクルを「方向付け」「推敲（すいこう）」「作成」「移行」という４つのフェーズに分類し、これらのフェーズを経てリリースにいたります。
	各フェーズは１つ以上の反復で構成されます。
	このように、短いスパンで成果物をリリースし、その都度評価を行うことにより、リスクを最小化しようとしたのがＲＵＰのアジャイルプロセスです。

	統計・分析における開発現場の実態
	独立行政法人情報処理推進機構（ＩＰＡ）の統計（出典：『ソフトウェア開発データ白書２００８』）によると、実に９５％以上のプロジェクトがウォーターフォール型のライフサイクルで開発されています。
	恐らく、ウォーターフォール型のプロセスの方が誰にでも理解しやすいこと、改修案件の場合など前回のプロセスがウォーターフォール型であったため、今回も同じプロセスを採用するという心理が働いたりすることが原因ではないかと考えられます。
	次に、ユーザーの要求仕様に関して、３５％以上のプロジェクトは「あいまい」であり、３０％以上のプロジェクトで「ユーザー担当者の要求仕様への関与が不十分」という統計もあります。
	その結果、ＱＣＤをすべて達成したと評価するプロジェクトは全体の２／３程度で、残りは品質、コスト、工期のいずれかの項目が計画通りに達成できなかったというデータもあります。
	このように、３つに１つのプロジェクトは、ウォーターフォールの当初の計画通りに進んでないということになります。
	つまり、プロジェクトの初期段階で完全な計画を立てるのは非常に難しいことが分かります。

	どのような開発手法においても、プロジェクトには必ずリスクが存在します。
	プロジェクト失敗の原因の多くは以下のようなものです。
	・スケジュールの欠陥―強気過ぎるスケジュールは悪。
	予実の乖離（かいり）を生み出す。
	・要求の増大（変更）―外的要因も影響し、時間の経過と共に要求は変わっていく。
	・人員の離脱―見積もりの時点で、メンバー離職の可能性は大抵考慮されていない。
	・仕様の崩壊―仕様はあいまいに作れるが、製品はあいまいに作れない。
	・生産性の低迷―少人数チームでは平均値のブレが大きい。
	能力がマイナスに振れるリスク
	これらのリスクが担保できるのであれば、開発プロセスがアジャイルでもウォーターフォールであっても構いません。
	それぞれのメリット・デメリットを検討した上、よりプロジェクトが成功しやすい開発プロセスを選択すべきです。

	光というのは、表現の上で非常に重要な要素です。
	伝統芸能の時代から、たとえば「能」では、演者のつける仮面はすべての感情をそぎ落とした無表情なものですが、光があたることで喜びや悲しみを変幻自在に表現してきました。
	現代でも舞台を作り上げる時やテレビの収録など、照明係というのは欠かせないポジションになっています。

	ＨＤＲの映像の特徴は明暗のコントラストがはっきりとし、使える色域が広いので、奥行きや立体感のある描写ができます。
	そのため、臨場感のある映像になるとのこと。
	ＨＤＲの映像は対応するテレビで見られますが、有機ＥＬディスプレイ採用テレビはノイズが少ないので、より楽しむことができるそうです。
	そこで今回は、日本市場で国内メーカー初の４Ｋ有機ＥＬテレビである、東芝「４Ｋ有機ＥＬレグザ×９１０シリーズ」での上映会となりました。
	ＨＤＲならではの真価を感じられる、いわば究極のテレビというわけですね。

	ヒトに強く訴えかける光の効果
	細かく明暗差が変えられるというのは、光の調整ができるということです。
	光というのは五感の長といわれる「目」で感じられる最初のものですし、「走光性」もあるように最も生物の本能に訴えかけるもののひとつです。
	光が微調整できる効果は映像１枚できれいだと思わせるだけではありません。
	前後の映像の違いに光の差を加えることで、心情の細かな表現までも可能にします。
	暗い部屋に明るい光が差し込むシーン
	例えば、最初に地下室の暗い中で一人で生活をしていた主人公が明るい光の中で自分以外の人と出会うシーンがあるのですが、明暗差をはっきりつけることで孤独さから温かさ、そしてまぶしさや戸惑いといった主人公が感じる世界の変化、その後の暗い宇宙に飛び出すシーンでは、明るい所から再び不安感を誘う闇の中に身を投じる感覚をより深く体感できました。

	よって、「黒と白を段階的に細かく表現できる」ＨＤＲの効果がいかんなく感じられる、ＨＤＲ化にふさわしい作品といえるでしょう。
	今回は左はＨＤＲ、右はＳＤＲで２台「４Ｋ有機ＥＬレグザ６５×９１０」のテレビが置かれており、その差を実感できるようになっていました。
	一目ぱっと見ただけでもＨＤＲの方はコントラストがしっかりとし、映像全体が濃く見えるだけではなく、深みが出て迫力が増したと感じました。

	ＦＦと違ってＦＲではエンジンの動力をシャフトを使って後輪に伝える必要があります。
	ＦＦよりも大がかりなので、比較的故障する確率は高いと言えます。
	ＦＦではエンジンが横置きなので、クルマの室内が広く取れるというメリットがありました。
	逆にＦＲではエンジンが縦置きなので、室内を広くするためには、結局、クルマ自体を大きくするしかありません。
	するとエンジンの回転方向をタイヤに対して９０度の向きで置く必要が出てきます。
	これをシャフトでクルマの後部に伝え、そこでギアを使って再び向きを９０度変えて後輪を回すわけです。

	なお、高級車＝ＦＲという話になりましたが、スポーツカーの世界でも後輪駆動が主流です。
	Ｆ１などのレーシングカーはＭＲですし、前回も書いたようにポルシェの代表車種はＲＲです。
	フェラーリもランボルギーニもＭＲです。
	エンジンの置き場所こそ違えど、駆動輪はみんな後輪です。
	レーシングにおいては自動車のバランスは非常に重要です。
	ＦＦ車はどうしてもクルマの前部が重くなりますが、後輪駆動車は前後のバランスが均等に近くなります。
	また後輪駆動のほうがアンダーステアが発生しにくい（オーバーステアが発生しやすい）ので、コーナーを曲がることが重視されるレースの世界では重宝されます。

	ＢＭＷのクルマは全て、車体前部に縦に置かれたエンジンから生み出されるパワーをリア・ホイールへと伝達させます。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズも例外ではありません。
	後輪駆動方式は伝統的なＢＭＷの特徴であり、魅力的な走り、優れたトラクション、安心できるハンドリングを実現する大事な要素なのです。
	後輪駆動の有効性は、荷物を積むほど高まります。
	前輪を駆動するクルマでは、満載状態になると前車軸への荷重が減少して、トラクションに悪影響を及ぼします。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズならば、このようなことは起こりません。

	インフルエンザの種類
	ヒトに感染するインフルエンザウイルスには、Ａ型・Ｂ型・Ｃ型の３つがあり、現在流行の中心となっているのはＡ型とＢ型です。
	Ａ型は症状が重篤になる傾向があり、死に至ることもあります。
	また感染力が強いため、大流行（パンデミック）を起こしやすく、過去には香港かぜやスペインかぜなどの世界的な流行で多くの死者を出しました。
	２００９年に世界中で流行したいわゆる「新型インフルエンザ」は、Ａ型、Ｈ１Ｎ１亜型というものでした。
	Ｂ型は、Ａ型よりも症状が比較的軽く、限られた地域で流行するケースが見られます。
	Ｃ型は鼻かぜ程度の軽い症状ですむことが多いウイルスです。

	インフルエンザの治療
	【一般療法】
	できるだけ安静にし、栄養と十分な睡眠を取ります。
	インフルエンザウイルスの空気中での活動や感染を抑えるために、加湿器などで室内の湿度を５０〜６０％に保ちます。
	水分を十分に補います。
	お茶、スープ、ジュースなど何でもいいので飲みたいものを飲みます。
	【対症療法】
	発熱や関節痛などに対しては解熱鎮痛薬、鼻水やくしゃみに抗ヒスタミン薬などが用いられます。
	一方、インフルエンザの症状はインフルエンザウイルスに対して免疫が正常に働いている結果であり、薬で無理に抑えないほうがよいという考え方もあります。
	市販の薬を自己判断で使用することは、かえって逆効果になる場合があるので、医師の指示にしたがってください。

	インフルエンザの予防
	インフルエンザの予防に効果が期待できるのがワクチンの接種です。
	流行シーズンを迎える前の１１月ごろの接種をおすすめします。
	インフルエンザワクチンは、１３歳未満は原則として、２〜４週間の間隔をおいて２回接種します。
	１３歳〜６４歳は１回または２回かは医師と相談して決めてください。
	６５歳以上の高齢者や過去にインフルエンザにかかったことがある人なら、１回の予防接種でも十分な免疫力が得られるといわれています。
	効果が現われるのはおよそ２週間後からで、その後約５カ月間持続するといわれています。

	【抗ウイルス療法】
	インフルエンザウイルスに対する治療薬として、塩酸アマンタジンとノイラミニダーゼ阻害薬があります。
	塩酸アマンタジンはＡ型インフルエンザウイルスに有効で耐性が起こりやすいのですが、ノイラミニダーゼ阻害薬はＡ型、Ｂ型どちらのインフルエンザウイルスにも有効です。
	但し、これらの抗ウイルス薬は発病後４８時間以内に服用しないと効果がありません。
	また、現在日本ではノイラミニダーゼ阻害薬のリン酸オセルタミビルと塩酸アマンタジンを予防薬として使用することができますが、１３歳以上に限るという制限など、いくつかの条件があるので医療機関に相談してください。

	といっても、一般の電車のような、大きなひし形のものではありません。
	架線に接地する小さなもので、一般的にはシューとか靴と呼ばれています。
	一般的な電車のように、電気を取り入れないときも折りたたまれずに、電気的に遮断されているだけです。
	写真では、非常に判りにくいのですが、第三軌条に接地している平らな板が見えると思います。
	これがモノレールのパンタグラフなんです。
	上の案内輪の写真を見ていただければ、上についているタイヤの下に、白い丸いものと赤い板が付いているのが判ると思います。
	これは、第三軌条やパンタグラフから取り入れた電気によって、タイヤや台車機器が破損しないようにするために、絶縁のために取り付けられているのです。

	走行にはゴムタイヤが使用され、Ｉ型のレールを両側から挟みこむようにゴムタイヤは配置されています。
	また、単に両側から挟みこむだけでは安定しないので、上下２段、２対のゴムタイヤが配置され、走行の安定性を保証しています。
	このようにして、１本だけの不安定なレールの上を、安定して走ることが出来るのです。
	この車輪が存在することで、走行方向などが案内されるために、案内輪と言われています。
	写真は、ゴムタイヤがレールを挟んでいる様子です。
	上のほうと下のほうに、タイヤが分かれて並んでいるのが判ると思います。
	１本のレールを挟んで安定させる方式は、上記で判っていただけたと思います。

	信用取引の最大の特徴は、自己資金の約３倍の取引ができることです。
	たとえば、自己資金が２００万円の方は、約６００万円までの取引ができます。
	残りの約４００万円は証券会社から借りることになります。
	また、今現在、手元に株式を保有していなくても、証券会社からその株式を借りることで、「売り」から始めることもできます。

	この投資家の方は、シャープの株価が下がると予想していたため、証券会社からシャープの株を借りてきて、その株を売りました。
	シャープの株価が下がったら、その時点でシャープの株を買い戻して、証券会社にシャープの株を返済するつもりでした。
	ところが、この投資家の意に反してシャープの株価は上昇してしまいました。
	この投資家の方は高い株価でシャープの株を買い戻して証券会社にシャープ株を返済する羽目になったのです。
	信用取引の場合は自己資金の約３倍の売買が可能になるため、利益も損失も大きくなりがちなのです。
	初心者の方は信用取引には決して手を出さず、最低３年程度は現物取引（通常の株式投資）で経験を積んでください。
	３まとめ
	株で大損しないために最低限すべきことをお分かりいただけたでしょうか。
	自分を守る最低限の知識は身に着ける、注文するときは細心の注意を払う、そして損切りルールを定めて冷徹にそれを実行する。
	とても地味ですが、この３つが株で大損しないための鉄則です。
	まずは、大損しないことを強く意識して投資経験を積み、勝率を上げていきましょう。

	国債金利は
	国債の買い手が増える→国債金利が下がる
	国債の売り手が増える→国債金利が上がる
	という関係にあります。
	買う人が増えると、金利が小さくても売れるため、国債の金利が下がるのです。
	逆に売り手が多くて、買い手が少ない状況だと、金利を高く設定しないと売れないため、国債金利が上がるのです。

	日銀は金利ターゲットを導入した
	英国のＥＵ離脱の波及でさらに円高／株安、国債金利低下がすすむ可能性がある
	トランプ大統領就任によるドル高／円安／株高による住宅ローン金利上昇の影響は限定された範囲
	という理由から

	変動金利はそのままの低金利状態が維持される
	固定金利は金利ターゲットの影響で、１０年以上の固定金利はやや上昇。

	結果として、２０１６年は年末にかけて
	ドル高／円安→株高→国債金利上昇→住宅ローン金利上昇
	という動きが出ています。
	とはいえ、このまま住宅ローン金利が上昇するかというとそうではありません。
	トランプ大統領就任による期待値込みのご祝儀相場でドル高になっているだけ
	国債金利上昇で企業への融資が冷え込むのは日本政府はなんとしても避けたいので国債買入れを増強して金利を下げさせる
	金利ターゲットがあるので、国債金利も０．０％ぐらいに着地させるはず
	たしかに株価は上がっていますが、日本の景気とは関係のないところで上がっただけですから、住宅ローン金利が上昇する根本的な要因にはなっていません。

	・景気は良くなるのか？
	日本の景気が良くなれば、政策金利が上昇することになり、変動金利が高くなります。
	しかし、２０１７年という時点での景気回復は見通しが立っていないのが現状です。
	アベノミクスでの株価上昇というのは経済が良くなったのではなく、為替介入による円安誘導で株価が上がったに過ぎません。
	円安になると輸出企業の多い日本では、株高になるからです。
	日本円というのは不思議な立ち位置で、世界の経済情勢が悪化すると、外国人投資家・機関投資家はすぐに「円買い」に動きます。
	世界的にはまだ「円」は安全な通貨と認識されているのです。
	世界のどこかで経済的な不安を感じさせる事件があれば、すぐに円高になり、株安に戻ってしまうのです。
	為替だけでつくられたまやかしの株高は長くは続かないのです。
	アベノミクスの流れに沿うように商品価格を上げた企業も、続々とデフレ基準の価格に戻しています。
	個人の収入が増えていないのですから「商品価格を上げても売れなくなっただけ」というのがここ２年ぐらいでばれてしまったのです。
	為替に頼らないで景気回復をするためには、構造改革が必要となり、時間を要するのです。
	２０１７年に景気が回復する見通しというのは立たないのです。

	・硬毛化・多毛化
	産毛が濃く硬くなったり、生えていなかった場所から毛が生えることがあります。
	科学的原因はハッキリしていませんが、熱量が関係していると言われています。
	同じ熱量でも太い毛は熱を集めることができるので毛の抑制が上手くいきます。
	一方、産毛などに同じ熱量を照射した場合、メラニン色素が少ないため、熱を毛に上手く届けることができず、結果弱い熱量が毛に届きます。
	これが、成長を活性化させているという説が有力です。

	・肌が乾燥しやすくなる
	光脱毛は施術時に光の熱エネルギーを使用するため、熱が水分を奪い肌が乾燥しやすくなります。
	また、毛の原料はタンパク質で、タンパク質を凝固させることで毛の成長を抑制していきます。
	この、タンパク質が固まる際に多くの水分を必要とするため一時的に肌が乾燥してしまいます。

	・毛嚢炎のリスク
	カミソリなどの自己処理に比べると毛嚢炎ができる確率は低いですが、ゼロではありません。
	毛穴が少し傷ついただけで毛嚢炎はできることがあります。
	光脱毛では、熱を利用してムダ毛にダメージを与える仕組みなので、毛根周辺の毛包や表皮にも多少の熱ダメージが残ります。
	脱毛施術後の肌は一時的にバリア機能が下がりやすいので、ブドウ球菌がダメージを受けた毛包に入り込んできて、毛嚢炎を引き起こしてしまうことがあります。

	日焼けした肌が脱毛できない理由
	脱毛機はメラニン（黒いもの）に反応する仕組み→肌が日焼けで黒くなる→毛の黒に反応しにくくなる
	日焼けで肌が乾燥する→痛みを感じやすくなる
	日焼けで肌が黒くなる→メラニンに必要以上に反応して痛みを感じやすくなる
	対策
	小麦肌が好きな方は、夏は特に焼きたいと思うので、夏までに脱毛が完了するよに計算して脱毛を開始しましょう。
	脱毛期間中は日焼けを控えて、脱毛完了後肌が落ち着いてから焼くのがオススメです。
	オススメのコース
	ラヴォーグのスピードパックだと最短半年で全身の脱毛が完了回数の１２回通えます。

	上記の表で着目していただきたいのは脱毛完了までの総費用です。
	一見お得に見える自己処理ですが、２００円のカミソリで自己処理をし続けると、１２９６０００円もかかるのは驚きですよね。
	費用・手間・時間もかかる自宅での自己処理は効率が悪いうえに、肌荒れのリスクは１番高いためオススメできません。
	カミソリでのお手入れって安く済ませたいからしてることなのに、総費用がこんなにかかるなんて驚き・・・それならサロン脱毛で安全に脱毛したほうがいいね・・・
	光脱毛ｖｓ医療脱毛
	大きな違いは使用する機械の出力と毛根を破壊できるかにあります。
	毛根を破壊していいかは法律で決まっているので、サロンでの脱毛で毛根を破壊することは禁止されています。
	光脱毛
	出力が弱く毛根は破壊してはいけない
	医療脱毛
	出力が高く毛根を破壊できる
	毛根を破壊できたほうが脱毛完了までの期間がグッと縮まります。
	これだけ聞くと、医療脱毛の方がいいの？となりがちですが、医療脱毛にもデメリットがあります。

	コーディング規約のメリット・デメリット
	コーディング規約のメリットはプログラマの個性を殺して均質なプログラムを作ること、過去の知識や経験から得られたバグの発生源となりやすいコーディングの防止、インデントやコメントの基準を決めて見やすさ保守性の高さを求める・・・等々です。
	一方、デメリットですが、使える文法を制限してスキルの高いプログラマの生産性を殺したり、過去のプログラムとの互換性を追求するあまり新しい機能の使用を制限したり・・・等々があります。
	一般に、大きなプロジェクトほどコーディング規約の内容は強制的、制限的です。
	これは、大きなプロジェクトだと、スキルの低い人もメンバーに入っていることが多く、コーディングを自由にやらせると、品質が落ちたり、プログラムが見づらく保守性が悪くなるったりするためです。

	しかし看護師になれば、それなりの責任を負わなければいけなくなりますので、子育てをしながら働いている方などは、そうしたことによる業務負担の増加を避けるために、准看護師のままでいようとする方もいます。
	どんなスタンスで働くかは重要ですが、
	・収入
	・時間
	・看護学校への費用
	トータルで看護師と准看護師の違いを考えどちらに進むかを考えるべきでしょう。

	安いお酒を避け、高いお酒を飲む
	お酒の値段は非常に重要な二日酔いの指標になります。
	理由は値段が高いほどより不純物を取り除く（メタノールを含む）作業が多く行われているからです。
	同じ蒸留酒であっても高いお酒を飲むほうが二日酔いしにくく体にも優しくなります。
	同じお酒でもメーカーなどによっても成分は異なる
	同じ値段のビールであってもＡ社だと二日酔いしないがＳ社だと二日酔いしやすい、とうい現象はよくあることです。

	不純物入りを避ける
	ある実験で赤ワインと白ワインを飲んだグループを比較した所、赤ワインを飲んだグループの方が血中セントロニン、ヒスタミンの濃度が高く、二日酔いによる頭痛の程度が激しかったという結果が出ました。
	これはアルコールに含まれる不純物の量による違いです。
	意外ですが、ウォッカはアルコール濃度の割りには二日酔いしにくくなっています。
	ウォッカはバーボンの１／３７の不純物しか含まれません。
	メタノール含有は避ける
	メタノール含有は避けるウィスキーやブランデーといった風味が強く独特のクセのある蒸留酒やワインなどの果実酒には、微量のメタノールが含まれています。
	これらメタノールは通常のアルコールと比較すると身体に長く留まります。
	理由はエタノールの分解がメタノールにより阻害されることと、メタノールは分解に非常に長い時間がかかるためです。
	その結果、翌朝以降もお酒が残ってしまい二日酔いの症状が長引く原因となります。
	また、メタノールそのものが有毒であり、少量であっても頭痛、めまい、吐き気の原因になります。
	同じビールであっても柑橘系のビールだと二日酔いしやすいなどはこのメタノールが原因かもしれません。
	メタノールが原因の二日酔いについてはメタノールが原因の二日酔い対策をご参照下さい。

	真面目の説明には「誠実」という言葉が使われている。
	それは、うそやいいかげんなことがないっていう所とも重なる。
	一方で、真剣には「誠実」に値する言葉が使われていない。
	元が「本物の刀剣」っていう意味だから、お遊びでやってるわけじゃない、っていうのが派生して今の用法になったのだろう。

	ビジネスとしては取り入れにくいが、そのふわっとした髪が女性に人気が高いヘアスタイル。
	ロングヘアは少しＵＰしてマッシュスタイルにすることで綺麗なシルエットになります。
	サイドは軽めのツーブロックでメリハリをつけ、全体は束感を出せるようにセニングカットを施してきましょう。
	パーマは外ハネとニュアンスを組み合わせたミックスパーマがおすすめ。
	髪型のセット方法
	全体に空気を入れるように乾かしていく。
	その後水分を少し含んだ状態でワックスを揉み込む。
	ワックスが馴染んだら、軽く流れを作っていく。
	毛束はほぐさず、少し大きめぐらいにしておく。
	最後に外ハネを作り、スプレーをかければ完成。

	こんな時は尊敬語？謙譲語？
	尊敬語と謙譲語がひととおりマスターできても、時にどちらを使えばよいのか迷ってしまうシーンもあります。
	それは、敬語を使うべき相手が複数いる場合です。
	たとえばお客様に対して自分の上司について話をするには、どうしたらよいのでしょうか？自分にとっては、お客様も上司も尊敬すべき相手です。
	お待たせしているお客様に対して仮に「〇〇課長がまもなくお越しになりますので、お待ちください。」と言ってしまうと、上司に尊敬語を使ったために、お客様は相対的に上司よりも下になってしまいました。
	この場合は、身内である上司の事は謙譲語で扱います。
	「〇〇がまもなく参りますので、お待ちください。」といえばお客様が持ち上がり、正しい使い方になります。

	疫病が蔓延してしまったら
	疫病は初期の頃は発祥する葉数が少ないので葉を摘葉して対策することが出来ますが、株全体に疫病が広がってしまった時は、薬剤を使わない場合は株ごと除去するしか手立てはありません。
	マンションなどで数株だけ栽培している時は、株ごと抜き取る事が出来ないことが多いので、その時は薬剤を利用することを検討して下さい。
	生育初期や収穫前の薬剤使用であれば、決められた量と決められた回数を守って使用すれば人体への影響は殆どありません。

	疫病の発生条件（発病条件）と原因は？
	ナスの疫病（褐色腐敗病）
	疫病は収穫を終えた残渣（ざんさ）の中で越冬して、翌年に適度な温度と湿度になると発芽して胞子が生まれます。
	その胞子が灌水時の泥の跳ね返りによって新しく植えた苗の葉に付着して発病してしまうのです。
	疫病は低温多湿の気候が続くと発生しやすくなります。

	疫病の症状と見分け方疫病はどの野菜にも発生する「カビ」による病気で、初期は下葉に水が染みたような病斑が発生し徐々に茎や果実に暗褐色の大きな病斑が発生するようになります。
	疫病が進行すると病斑にうっすらとした白色のカビが生えます。
	特にトマトに良く発生する病気で被害が大きくなります。
	ナスに発生する褐色腐敗病はピーマンやカボチャと同じ疫病菌によるものでナスの果実に発病するとやや凹みがある褐色の病斑となります。

	一口にコミュニケーションと言っても、範囲が広すぎて、何が何なのか、わからないですよね。
	ここでいうコミュニケーションというのは主に以下の３つのこと
	・相手への気遣い
	・相手への尊敬
	・相手を認めてあげること
	これらが足りなくなると、よっぽどの理由がないかぎり、相手との関係は崩壊します。
	考えてみてください、もしあなたの目の前にいる人が、あなたに対して
	・自分の意見ばかりを押し通そうとしたりして、あなたにはまったく気を使わない
	・あなたの事を、なんだこいつ？といった感じで見下している
	・あなたの事をどうせ、ダメだろ。
	出来る訳ない。
	などと決めつけている
	としたら、あなたは相手に対してどう思いますか？当然良い気分ではないでしょうし、一緒に居たいとは思いませんよね。

	つまり、ヌクレオチドがたくさん集まったものがＤＮＡであり、この長いＤＮＡの一部に、遺伝子領域と呼ばれる部分があるのです。
	ＤＮＡとは、生物の細胞や組織を作り上げるのに必要なすべての情報を蓄えた図書館のようなものです。
	この情報は親から子へと、世代を通じて伝えられていくのです。
	しかし、情報が伝えられるといっても、遺伝子が親から子へと伝えられるという言い方は正確ではありません。
	正確には、ＤＮＡが親から子へと伝えられるため、そのＤＮＡ上にある遺伝子も結果的に親から子へと伝えられているのです。
	この遺伝子がＤＮＡ上に存在する状態を「遺伝子がＤＮＡ上にコードされている」と言います。

	すべてのヌクレオチドの構造は基本的に共通しており、リン酸基、五炭糖、塩基という３つの部分からできています。
	ただし、この中で塩基と呼ばれる部分だけが４種類で異なっているため、４種類のヌクレオチドが存在するのです。
	ＤＮＡを構成しているヌクレオチドには、アデニン（Ａ）、チミン（Ｔ）、グアニン（Ｇ）、シトシン（Ｃ）があります。
	一般的に、これらの４つのヌクレオチドは略して「ＡＴＧＣ」と表記されています。
	テレビや映画などで、遺伝情報を「ＡＴＧＧＧＣＡＴＴＴＡＡＡ」などという形式で表記されたものを見たことはありませんか？
	ＤＮＡとは、「ＡＴＧＣ」の４種類のヌクレオチドが何百万個と並んでできており、その並び方は、生物によって決まっています。
	この「ＡＴＧＣ」の並びのことを「塩基配列」と呼びます。

	問題がなければ、６ヶ月程度で商標が登録されるという。
	一方、手数料の支払いがなかったり、（１）申請した商標を使った商品、サービスなどが実現する可能性が低い（２）他人が許可なく著名な名称で出願する（３）「五輪」のような公共性の高い名称を出願する−などに該当すると判断されたりした場合、登録が認められない。
	特許庁は、今回の「ＰＰＡＰ」の商標出願問題について、「個別の案件に関してはコメント差し控える」と回答。
	ただ、こうした審査基準に照らせば、大阪府の企業がピコ太郎側から承諾を得ていない場合、商標登録がされる可能性は低い。

	サラリーマンの方が割りがいい
	ラーメンは作るより食べるのが好き
	実際開業してやめていく人達もこの３つに当てはまる人が多いようです。
	休みなんて定休日のみですから基本週一日ですし、他にやりがいを見つけないと厳しい世界なのかもしれませんね。

	リスクの減らし方をいくつか前持って確認しておきましょう。
	お金をかけるほどリスク
	冒頭でも話したとおり、お店作りにお金をかけるのはリスクにしかなりません。
	なぜなら、お金をかければ儲かるというわけではないからです。
	そして場所が良くても家賃が高いことも廃業のリスクになります。

	単純計算すると、
	麺５０円＋スープ５０円＋チャーシュー５０円＋具材５０円
	というところで、大体２００円前後。
	飲食店の原価率は３０％を目安にするので一杯６５０円が基準になりそうです。
	例えば１日平均７０杯売り上げたとすると１３０万円ほどになります。
	ここから原価を３０％引き、一人従業員を雇ったとして２０万円の給料。
	家賃などの支払いが込み込みで１０万円だったとすると、簡単計算でも
	月収７０万円！

	ニューギニア山中の現地人は１３７種の鳥を識別している。
	分類学者が調べたところその地域に生息する鳥は１３８種で現地人は１種だけをよく似た他の種と混同しているにすぎないことが分かった。
	このように生物に名前をつけて区別することは人間の生活にとって大切であり必要なことであった。
	現在までに約１８０万種の生物に名前が付けられている。
	これらは生物学的にどのように分類されているのだろうか。

	古代ギリシアのアリストテレスは『動物誌』で動物を有血動物と無血動物に大別し有血動物は哺乳類鳥類卵生四足類魚類の四種類無血動物は軟体類甲殻類昆虫類有殻類から構成されると分類していた。
	有血動物は現在の脊椎動物無血動物は無脊椎動物に相当する。
	現在は界門綱目科属種の分類単位がおかれている。
	各階層の他に必要な場合には中間の階層を置くことがある。
	この場合のには「亜」をつけ亜目・亜科などとする。
	たとえばヒトの分類学的位置は動物界脊つい動物門ほ乳綱サル目（霊長目）ヒト科ヒト亜科ヒト属のヒトである。
	学名はＨｏｍｏｓａｐｉｅｎｓＬＩＮＮＡＥＵＳ１７５８である。
	類人猿もヒト科に含まれヒト科とサルの仲間がサル目に含まれる。
	分類の階層を上がるほど違いが大きくなる。
	なお近年は界より上にドメイン（ｄｏｍａｉｎ）を設ける場合がある。

	実際に分類するときの実例にそって説明してみよう。
	分岐分類では、内群と外群の生物を比較して派生形質を決定し共有派生形質をもつ集団でクレードを形成する。
	内群とは実際に分析を行おうとしている集団である。
	外群は内群より前に進化したことが明らかな種である。
	内群のメンバーの形質を外群と比較することによって区別点を決めることが出来る。
	たとえば、下左図（略）の例では内群のすべての動物は毛と乳腺をもつ。
	これらの形質は外群のイグアナにはない。
	そこでこの内群は、哺乳類のクレードとまとめることができる。
	しかし内群の動物のなかでカモノハシには母体の子宮で育児をする妊娠がない。
	このことからカモノハシは内群のクレードで初期の分岐をしたと推測することができる。
	分岐分類は進化上の変化つまり分岐点に焦点を当てる方法である。
	分岐分類の結果が従来の分類とちがう結果をもたらす場合がある。

	番外．Ｓｃａｌａとは
	・どんな言語か
	最近私がハマっている関数型オブジェクト指向言語。
	コンパイルされるとＪａｖａと同じｃｌａｓｓファイルに変換され、ＪＶＭ上で動作する。
	言語のイメージはここを見ればだいたい分かってもらえると思う。
	（ＵＲＬ）
	・長所
	Ｊａｖａ並の実行速度とＲｕｂｙ並の書きやすさが合わさり最強に見える。
	Ｊａｖａの資産が使い放題で、Ｅｒｌａｎｇのような並列処理まで合わせ持つのでもう手に負えない。
	コードの量もその辺のスクリプト言語並に短くて済む。
	・短所
	覚えるのにけっこう時間がかかる。
	ＣやＣ＋＋ほどではないけどＪａｖａよりも難易度高め。

	シャープ設定の調整（続き）
	次の２つのシャープ設定は重要です。
	半径では、写真にシャープを適用する際のディテールの細かさを指定します。
	半径の値を小さくすると、ディテールの細かいものが多い風景などの写真が美しく仕上がります。
	静物や人物など、それほどディテールの細かくない写真では、半径の値は大きい方が適しています。
	サンプルの写真は、半径が１．０に設定されています。
	ディテールでは、写真の中でエッジを強調する度合いを指定します。
	ディテールの値が高いほどテクスチャの輪郭がはっきりし、値が低いほどピンぼけがなくなります。
	サンプルの写真は、ディテールが２５に設定されています。

	農地を売却する場合、その農地が市街化区域内に位置しているか市街化調整区域に位置しているかということと、登記簿謄本の中でどの地目に属しているということで条件が変わります。
	市街化区域で地目が田または畑の場合
	農地転用の手続きは必要ですが、売却は可能です。
	市町村の農業委員会に農地法第５条の届け出を提出することで、所有権移転することができます。
	売却しようとしている農地が市街化調整区域、都市計画区域外、無指定区域のどれかに位置していた場合
	農業委員会からの許可が必要です。
	農業振興地域に指定されていたり、農地以外に転用を認めない地域に位置していた場合は宅地として売却することはかなり困難です。
	一部の市町村では、調整区域の取り扱いが変わり、市街化区域以外でも宅地として使えるように規制が緩和されている地域もあります。
	市町村によって、規制が違いますので、売却予定の農地がある地域の役所にある都市計画課や建設課などに相談する必要があります。
	これは、なるべく効率よく農業経営を行うことを目的に決められているものです。

	ハウスの中は、紫色の食用菊「もってのほか」がこれでもかと咲き誇り、あとは、摘み取りを待つばかり。
	天にむかって、花びらを突き上げる姿に、強い強い野生を感じました。

	これは、菊の花に鎮痛作用や解毒作用、解熱作用があると考えられているためで、動脈硬化の漢方薬に配合されることもあります。
	日本大学薬学部・理学部の研究では・・・
	食用菊に含まれているクロロゲン酸とイソクロロゲン酸は、動脈硬化などの生活習慣病を引き起こす元凶となる悪玉コレステロールの低下、中性脂肪を低下させる効果があると発表されています。
	「もってのほか」には、クロロゲン酸とイソクロロゲン酸が特に多く含まれているそうです。
	また、山形県衛生研究所では、「もってのほか」の花びらに含まれるヘリアントリオールＣとファラジオールが発ガン予防に優れた効果を示していると実証されています。
	自律神経を安定させる働きも。
	これは、菊花の香りの成分（テルペン）は、リラックス効果が高くイライラを取り除いてくれるためだと言われています。
	最近の研究では菊の花の匂い成分が脳神経の機能を回復し、脳の老化を予防するという研究報告もあります。

	摂取のポイント
	野菜は茹でたり、煮たりする
	生野菜３００ｇに含まれる食物繊維はおよそ１０ｇ。
	野菜は加熱するとカサが減るので、少量で効率よく食物繊維を補うことができます。
	米やパンは精製していないものを選ぶ
	米なら玄米や七分づき米、パンならライ麦パンや全粒粉パン、小麦胚芽入りのものを選びましょう。
	白より茶色のものの方が、より多く食物繊維を含んでいます。
	和食のお惣菜を積極的に
	きんぴらごぼう・ひじき・切干大根など和食のお惣菜は、食物繊維が多い食材を使用しているものが多いのでおすすめです。

	例えば１００万円で買った株式が期間終了時に３０万円に値下がりしていると、その株式の取得価格は３０万円となる。
	その後、５０万円で売却した場合、本来なら５０万円の損なのに、新取得価格との差額の２０万円が利益と見なされ課税されてしまうのだ。

	ＮＩＳＡ向きの商品やＮＩＳＡの落とし穴、誤解されやすいポイントも紹介しよう！
	制度や運用の相談をするなら大手証券の窓口も候補に
	ＮＩＳＡの難点をどこまでカバーできるか、利用者の多い６種類の金融機関を比較してみた。
	株式投資を念頭に入れるなら、証券会社での開設が絶対条件となる。
	コスト面や品ぞろえではネット証券が有利だ。
	ただし、複雑なＮＩＳＡの説明を受けたい、運用の相談がしたい人は対面の証券や銀行がいい。
	大手証券なら投信の品ぞろえも豊富な上、コストの安いネット取引も併用可能なので有力な候補となる。
	身近で全国展開するゆうちょ銀行は居住地の移転への対応は万全だが、投信の品ぞろえの拡充に期待。

	危険性
	基本的にはサラダ油と同じ危険性を持っています。
	トランス脂肪酸を保有していますし、リノール酸も含まれています。
	キャノーラ油は加熱調理に使用することが多いので、リノール酸がヒドロキシノネナールになりやすいです。

	意外と知られていない危険性
	トランス脂肪酸
	サラダ油にはトランス脂肪酸という成分が含まれており、摂取し続けることによって狭心症や心筋梗塞などの冠動脈性心疾患（ＣＨＤ）になってしまう可能性があります。
	賞味期限が切れていたり、使いまわした古い油にはトランス脂肪酸が多く保有されています。
	さらに、酸化した油はトランス脂肪酸より害が大きいので注意が必要です。
	変な色や匂いがしたら酸化していますので、使わずに処分してしまいましょう。

	原料
	菜種、大豆、とうもろこし、ひまわりの種、ごま、紅花、綿実、こめ、ぶどうの９種類の原材料のうち、いずれかを用いて精製しています。
	また、２種類以上の原材料を混ぜて使う油もあり、その場合は調合サラダ油と言います。
	使い方
	味や匂いにクセがなく、サラダドレッシングの他、マヨネーズなどの原料にも使用されています。
	高温になると劣化しやすいため、炒めものや揚げ物などの料理には向いていないとされていますが、問題なく使用することができます。
	ただ、使い回して古くなった油は健康に害を及ぼしますのでご注意ください。

	スーパー等でよく見られる油は、サラダ油、キャノーラ油、ごま油、オリーブオイルでしょうか。
	他にも、大豆油、なたね油、ひまわり油なんかもありますね。
	基本的には、油の原料を名前に使っているので何からできた油かわかりやすいです。
	しかし、今紹介した中に何からできているのかわからないものがあります。
	サラダ油とキャノーラ油です。
	この２つは頻繁に見かけることがありますが、一体どんな違いがあるのでしょうか。

	サラダ油とは
	サラダ油とは、サラダ用ドレッシングに使用されることを前提とした食用油です。
	また、低温下でも凝固しない食用油でもあります。
	サラダなど、比較的低温で食べるものに油を使い結晶化してしまうと、食感に特有のざらつきがでてきてしまいます。
	それを防ぐために、低温で固化した成分を分離して、低温でも凝固しない油にしています。
	日本農林規格（ＪＡＳ規格）では０°Ｃの環境で５．５時間放置しても濁らない事がサラダ油の条件とされています。

	リノール酸
	サラダ油にはリノール酸という成分が含まれており、このリノール酸自体は私たちに必要な栄養素です。
	このような、私たちがとらなければならない油の成分を必須脂肪酸といい、血中コレステロールを下げる働きがあります。
	しかし、このリノール酸は加熱するとヒドロキシノネナールという神経毒に変わってしまい、脳を萎縮させてしまいます。
	その結果、もの忘れやアルツハイマー病、うつ病になってしまう可能性があるのです。
	また、このリノール酸を過剰に摂取し続けることによって、脳梗塞、心筋梗塞、がんになりやすくなり、アレルギー体質などを引き起こす原因ともなるのです。

	銀閣寺を建て始めた時期
	応仁の乱が終わって間もない時、銀閣寺の建設は始まります。
	ちなみに、応仁の乱は応仁元年（１４６７年）〜文明９年（１４７７年）です。
	建設が始まったのは文明１４年（１４８２年）の事です。
	銀閣寺が建った歴史背景
	１０年も続いた応仁の乱で人々はかなり疲弊、土地はボロボロの状態でしたが、
	その５年後から銀閣寺の建設が始まりました。
	当時は今よりも技術が無かった為、まだまだ土地は回復せず、
	人々も心が晴れるにはすごく時間がかかっていたでしょう。
	建設はそれから８年も続けられ、足利義政が亡くなる直前にやっと終わったそうです。

	５．案外難しい火の消し方
	火の消し方ですが、９割の方がフ〜ッと息を吹きかけて消すと思いますが、１番いいのはピンセットを使い火をつまんで消します。
	芯を立てる作業に使いますが消すと同時に立てておけば次回使う時に火がつきやすくなるので一石二鳥ですよ！

	火のつけ方ですが、最初が肝心で新品のキャンドルには表面部分のロウが全て溶けるまで、火をつけておくことです。
	途中で消してしまっては最後まできれいに溶けずに残ってしまいます。
	初めにロウを溶かしておいた部分しか溶けないので注意して下さいね。
	最初に使われるなら、夜に電気を消して灯りの代わりに使っていただくとすぐに消すようにはならないと思いますし、薄暗い中での良い香りはとっても精神的に安定する時間です！
	忙しくてスパに行けないという方には１時間自宅使っていると同程度の効果があります。
	４．キレイな炎を作る
	火の灯りが一定でない時には調整します。
	きれいに燃やすためには０．５ｃｍほどがベストです。
	長すぎるのはよくありませんので長ければハサミで芯を切って調整します。
	キレイな炎だと最後まで使える事が出来ます。
	いつでもすぐに使えるように灯りの調整は重要です。
	あっては困ることですが、もしもの災害時には停電になったりすることもありますが、そういう時にもアロマキャンドルを使うというのもあります。
	普通のロウソクより太く安定していますし、そこに不安な時間もアロマの香りで少しでも解消できるのではないかと思います。

	画像が不鮮明になることや、暗いシーンで起きやすくなることは同じですが、「ピンぼけ」と「手ぶれ」は原因も結果も異なる現象です。
	ピンぼけ・手ぶれレスキューのフィルターを上手に活用するためには、この区別を理解しておいた方が良いでしょう。
	まず、それぞれの現象の起きた画像を検討してみましょう。

	「手ぶれ」も「被写体ぶれ」も、共に暗いシーンで起きやすくなります。
	この画像は日没直前の暗い状況で撮ったもので、そのために１／２５秒というかなり長い時間シャッターを開いていたために生じた手ぶれ現象です。
	なお、「手ぶれ」と「被写体ぶれ」以外にも「ぶれ」の生じる場合があります。
	その多くは振動によるもので、自動車の走る橋の上から景色を撮る場合、三脚を据えていても橋の振動による「ぶれ」が生じます。
	あるいは、一眼レフカメラなどの場合、カメラ内部でミラーが動く振動が問題になる場合や、天体撮影などでは人体には関知できない地面の微かな振動さえもが「ぶれ」の原因となります。

	「ピンぼけ」の主な原因
	オートフォーカス（ＡＦ）機能使用時
	半シャッター操作をせず、いきなりシャッターを押し込んだ
	被写体の前後の別のものにピントを持って行かれた
	コントラストが低いなどピントの合いにくい被写体に対して、ピントを合わせ損なった
	暗いシーンだったため、オートフォーカス機能が十分に働かなかった
	最短焦点距離より被写体に近づきすぎた
	被写体の人物や動物が寄って来てしまった
	マクロモードにするのを忘れた、マクロモードから戻すのを忘れた
	マニュアルフォーカスを選択しているのを忘れていた
	コサイン誤差（フォーカス操作後に向きを変えたときの問題で、マクロ撮影時には問題になることがある）
	マニュアルフォーカス（ＭＦ）時
	ピントを合わせ損ねた
	絞りを開きすぎた
	マクロ撮影時、体が揺れてしまった
	マクロ撮影時、被写体が風で揺れた
	パンフォーカス機（フィルム付きカメラやカメラ付き携帯電話など）で
	近くや遠くに対しては、どうしてもピントが甘くなります

	固まった型取りシリコンを段ボール枠から取り出します。
	食品の埋め込まれた豆腐のようなものができています。
	食品サンプル型取り手順６
	食品を取り外します。
	水で流すなどしてできるだけきれいに取り去る
	水分を残さないようにする
	できるだけ取り出す穴をあけ過ぎないのがポイントです。
	また、食材の裏に塗ったコーキングが固まっていなくて手に付くことがあるので注意。
	食品サンプル型取り完成
	これで型取りは完成です。
	もったいない感じもしますが、取り出した食べ物を食べるのはやめておきましょう。

	農地売買の手数料
	農地として売る場合、個人間売買や農業関連機関の斡旋（あっせん）を利用する形態が主で、手数料は登記費用（登録免許税や司法書士報酬）くらいしか発生しません。
	転用による売買では、不動産会社に仲介依頼して売買できるので、登記費用の他にも不動産会社に対して仲介手数料を支払います。
	転用による売買では、転用前提であることを明示すれば、転用許可後に地目変更できるので、農地であっても宅地や雑種地同様に買いやすく、広く買主を探せます。
	したがって、売買価格も農地のまま売るよりも高くなることが想定され、不動産会社への仲介手数料も多くなります。

	転用して売買する場合の注意点
	農地転用には２種類あります。
	農地の所有者が自ら農地以外の用途で使用する目的
	他者への売買を目的
	農地の所有者が自ら使用するための転用は、農地法４条による転用許可で、売買が目的の農地法５条による転用許可とは扱いが異なります。
	ただ、最終的に他者へ売却するのなら、２つの違いは転用のタイミングに過ぎません。
	先に転用してから売却するか、売却と同時に転用するかという違いです。
	転用はどちらが先でも同じように思えますが、転用許可の制度上、単に転用する許可申請は認められず、転用後の事業計画を必要とします。
	例えば、「とりあえず農地から宅地や雑種地にしておき、後から買主が現れるまで待つ」というような転用許可申請は認められません。

	農地を農地以外にするための条件
	農地から農地以外の土地に変更することを転用と呼び、残念ながら転用はすべての農地で可能になっていません。
	許可されるかどうかは、「立地基準」と「一般基準」という２つの基準が関係します。
	「立地基準」とは、農地の区分で許可・不許可を決めるもので、優良で大規模な農地ほど許可されず、市街地に近いほど許可されやすくなります。
	農用地区域内農地：原則不許可
	甲種農地：原則不許可
	第１種農地：原則不許可
	第２種農地：周辺の他の土地に代えられなければ許可
	第３種農地：原則許可
	立地基準から、第２種農地と第３種農地以外は原則不許可で望み薄です。

	農地売買の大まかな流れ
	どのような農地売買でも、売買契約は農業委員会の許可を前提として締結されます。
	農地として売るなら農地法第３条による売買（所有権移転）許可、農地以外で売るなら農地法第５条による転用許可です（届出の場合もあります）。
	農地売買では、通常の不動産取引ではあまりない、「仮登記」を行うのが通常です。
	許可を条件とした売買契約を締結
	農業委員会に許可申請
	許可前に所有権移転請求権仮登記
	許可後に代金支払いと所有権移転登記（本登記）
	２．の農業委員会への許可申請と３．の仮登記は、順番が前後することに問題はなく、どちらも売買契約締結後、遅滞なく行う条項を１．の売買契約書に盛り込みます。
	また、３．仮登記は売買契約の絶対条件ではないですが、４．の許可まで買主が所有権を得られないために、買主による将来の確実な所有権移転を保全する目的で行われます。
	許可されると農業委員会から許可指令書が交付され、許可指令書がなければ農地の所有権移転登記は受け付けてもらえません。
	許可のない違法な所有権移転を防ぐために、このような仕組みになっています。

	農地を売買するからには、利用目的の主体が買主にあるため、売買での転用許可申請は、売主と買主の両方が申請者になり、おおむね次のような基準で判断されます。
	申請目的を実現できる資力や信用がある
	転用する農地の関係権利者から同意を得ている
	転用許可後速やかに申請目的のために使う見込みがある
	許認可が必要な事業で許認可を受けられる見込みがある
	事業のために必要な協議を行政と行っている
	転用する農地と一体に使用する土地を利用できる見込みがある
	事業の目的に適正な広さの農地である
	周囲の農地等への影響に適切な措置を講じる見込みがある
	一時的な転用では農地に戻されることが確実と認められる
	これらの条件から、「きちんと使えないなら転用させません」と分かります。

	１．アクセスは、簡単、便利で安い？
	アクセスは、ＶＢ（ビジュアルベーシック）などに比べると、簡単、便利で価格の安いソフトです。
	ＶＢ（ビジュアルベーシック）、Ｃ＋＋（シープラスプラス）、Ｃ＃（シーシャープ）などでプログラムを作成する場合、別途、データベースを準備する必要があります。
	また、帳票を作成するにはレポートのソフトも別に準備する必要があります。
	でも、アクセスには、データベースになるテーブルから、画面になるフォーム、帳票になるレポートなどシステムに必要な殆どの機能があります。
	このアクセスで企業の小規模なシステムは殆ど開発することができます。
	そして、アクセスのソフトは、２万円ちょっとで購入することができます。
	安いですね。
	２万円で、システムが出来るんです。
	でも、でも・・・・
	２．でもアクセスでのシステム開発は難しい？
	多くの人がアクセスを勉強しています。
	アクセスの市販の参考書もたくさん販売されています。
	いろいろな通信講座や通学講座があります。
	でも、一般的に、システム開発会社の方を除いて、アクセスをマスターしてシステムを開発している人は、多くはいません。
	何故でしょうか？

	１．年会費で選ぶ：
	クレジットカードを比較する上で一番カンタンなのが「年会費」。
	年会費というのはそのクレジットカードを１年間、保有するためにかかる会員費のことです。
	年会費とは、クレジットカードを１年保有するためにかかる費用のこと
	この年会費は０円、つまり無料に設定されているものから、富裕層向けの年会費３０万円以上かかるクレジットカードまで存在。
	クレジットカードを持つために年会費なんて払いたくない．．．という方は、まず、年会費無料のクレジットカードの中から選ぶようにしてください

	例えば私が現在利用しているダイナースクラブプレミアムカードはポイント還元率２％（マイル１．５円換算で３％還元）というとんでもなく素晴らしいカードなんですが、このカードの年会費は１０万円以上（苦笑）。
	ポイント獲得で年会費の元取るのはほぼほぼ不可能な状況です。
	年会費無料のカード
	ポイント獲得分すべてが得をするクレジットカードです。
	年会費無料のクレジットカードでポイント還元率が高いものがあればそれがベストですね。
	楽天カード、ライフカードあたりが最近の主力です。
	年会費有料のカード
	年間のポイント獲得金額から年会費を差し引いてポイント還元率を計算しなくてはいけません。
	例えば年間利用金額が１００万円で２万円分のポイント獲得、年会費１万円なら差し引き１万円の得で、ポイント還元率は１．０％になります。

	例えば、ロックのドラムなどではあまりパンを広げ過ぎると、確かにシンバルが広くなって豪快に聴こえるようですが、少しセンターと左右のスピーカーの真ん中辺りに穴が目立ってしまったりすることもあります。
	中抜けなイメージですよね。
	逆に、広がりのある音数の多い楽曲でエレピの伴奏をステレオ録音して、そのパンを放置していたら、ミックス全体がごちゃごちゃしてしまったりもします。
	では、どの様なパン振りをしたらいいのでしょうか？？
	まず、基本的にはキックとスネア、ベース、ボーカルはセンターに定位している事が多いと言えます。
	もちろん、ドラムを全て片方のチャンネルに振り切ってしまう、ビートルズが試していたようなミックスもありますが、ここではオーソドックスなパンについて説明していきます。
	それではセンターに位置するもの以外の楽器はどの様に配置していくのがいいのでしょうか？

	肩甲骨はがしのやり方
	まず簡単な方法として、
	【１】両手を肩にあてそのままヒジを大きくぐるぐると回すものです、前まわしと後ろまわしを５回くらいおこないましょう。
	【２】両手を上にあげ、手の平を内側に向けます。
	そのままひじを開くように腕をおろし背中を引き締めます。
	その時に、手の平を外側に向けるようにしましょう。
	肩甲骨を動かすことが目的になります。
	（１０回を２セット程度）
	【３】腰に掌を外側に向けた状態で添えて、両ひじを背中の後ろでつけるような気持ちでパタパタとさせます。
	もちろん、肩甲骨を意識して行います。
	（１０回を２セット）
	【４】最後にもう一度、両手を方にあててひじを大きくぐるぐる回すを、前まわしと後ろ周りで５回くらい行います。

	■東大理三、首都圏の合格者はほぼ鉄緑会
	「東大理三に首都圏から合格したほぼ全員がうちの生徒ですね。ここに通っていない子で合格したのは１人か２人ぐらいしかいないのでは」。
	鉄緑会会長の冨田賢太郎氏はこう話す。
	東大の１学年の定員枠は約３０００人だが、最難関の理三の枠は９７人しかいない。
	このうち鉄緑会から５４人が合格した。

	まずタンギングですが、バリトンの場合、クラシック的なきれいな発音を意識しすぎると低音域の輪郭がぼやけがちになります。
	従って、自分で「少しアタックが強すぎるかな？」と思うくらいのタンギングをしたほうが良いでしょう。
	ただ、むやみやたらに強くすると逆効果ですので、練習が必要です。

	あとバリトンの場合、マウスピースも違ってきます。
	アルト等で使われるセルマーＣ＊だと狭すぎます。
	クラシックの場合でもセルマーだったらＤ〜Ｅ。
	Ｓ９０でしたら１２０。
	ヤナギサワ等ならば７番くらいのモノをお薦めします。
	もっともこれは演奏者の体格、体力次第ですので、必要以上に番号の大きなモノを使っても意味がありません。
	それでも、ある程度のティップ・オープニング（くわえるところの広さ）があるとバリトンの場合劇的に楽になる場合があります。
	色々試してみて下さい。

	ロングトーン練習の時は、必ずメトロノームを使用すること。
	クレッシェンド、デクレッシェンドのロングトーンは、呼吸器系のみならず、アンブシュアを形成する上でも非常に有用ですので、通常のロングトーンと平行して必ず行って下さい。
	スケール練習にはクローゼの教則本が比較的取り組みやすい気がします。
	（といっても最近売ってるのか心許ないですが・・・ヤマハ等、大型店の輸入楽譜のコーナーにありました）
	で、ここからがバリトンの練習のポイントです。
	特に練習するべきなのは、タンギングと極端な低音域と高音域のコントロールです。

	低音域は得てして「もやもや」としてしまうか、爆発音となってしまうか、とにもかくにもバリトンの最大の武器にして泣き所です。
	それを小さな音のタンギング練習、並びに、やはり小さな音でのロングトーンで克服しましょう。
	もう一つ高音域も泣き所です。
	こちらは、自分で思うよりも少し多めの息を入れてやると良いでしょう。
	ただし上の方の音ではアンブシュアをきつくしてしまいがちです。
	意識して少し緩める位の気持ちで（本当は下から上まで一定なのが理想的ですが）息で音を支えてあげると良いでしょう。
	これもロングトーンが大事です。
	倍音練習（オーバートーン）も有用です。
	これは教則本が出ているはずなので探してみて下さい。
	「サクソフォーン・ハイトーンズ」というタイトルだったと思います。

	細菌が細胞壁を合成するとき、ペニシリン結合タンパク質（ＰＢＰ）という酵素が必要です。
	そこで、ペニシリン系抗生物質はペニシリン結合タンパク質（ＰＢＰ）に結合することで、その働きを阻害します。
	これにより、細菌が死んでいきます。

	ペニシリン系抗生物質は時間依存性の抗菌薬です。
	また、ＰＡＥが短い（血中濃度が低くなると細菌は増殖を開始する）という性質のため、常にＭＩＣよりも高い血中濃度を維持しなければいけません。
	ただ、ペニシリン系抗生物質の多くは半減期が１時間程度です。
	そのため、１日に何回も投与しなければいけません。
	通常は４〜６時間おきの投与が必要だとされています。
	適切な血中濃度を維持することで、薬の効果を最大限に得ることができ、さらには耐性菌の出現を防ぐことができます。

	ペニシリンＧが作用するのはグラム陽性球菌です。
	グラム陽性球菌としては、黄色ブドウ球菌や化膿レンサ球菌、肺炎球菌が知られています。
	ただし、黄色ブドウ球菌はβ−ラクタマーゼを作るようになったため、使用することはできません。
	肺炎球菌についても、同じように多くの耐性菌が確認されています。
	基本的にはグラム陽性球菌に活用しますが、グラム陰性球菌の中でも淋菌や髄膜炎菌に対してペニシリンＧは有効です。
	ただし、淋菌はペニシリンＧへの耐性化が進んでいることから、使用できないことも多いです。
	なお、ペニシリンＧが第一適応となるケースがあります。
	それは、梅毒を治療するときです。
	梅毒スピロヘータを治療するとき、他の抗菌薬よりもペニシリンＧが効果的なのです。
	抗生物質として最も古典的なペニシリンＧですが、化膿レンサ球菌や肺炎球菌、髄膜炎菌、梅毒スピロヘータに対して現在でも活用することがあるのです。

	基本的に、抗菌薬の開発が進むことでペニシリンの構造から離れていくと、グラム陽性菌への作用が弱まり、グラム陰性菌への作用が強まると考えてください。
	アミノペニシリンは古典的ペニシリンの次に開発されたペニシリン系抗生物質であり、化膿レンサ球菌や肺炎球菌への働きは弱くなっています。
	その代わり、グラム陰性桿菌の腸内細菌をカバーしています。
	例外として、アミノペニシリンではグラム陽性球菌の中でも腸球菌に対しては効果が強くなっています。
	これらアミノペニシリンとしては、アンピシリン・スルバクタム（商品名：ユナシン）、アモキシシリン（商品名：サワシリン）、アモキシシリン・クランブラン酸（商品名：オーグメンチン、クラバモックス）があります。
	スルバクタムとクランブラン酸はβ−ラクタマーゼ阻害薬であり、アミノペニシリンが分解されなくすることで抗生物質の効果を高めます。

	あらゆる細菌の中でも、緑膿菌は抗菌薬が効きにくい細菌として知られています。
	そこで、グラム陽性菌やグラム陰性菌、嫌気性菌に加え、緑膿菌への作用を示すペニシリン系抗生物質として抗緑膿菌ペニシリンが開発されています。
	抗緑膿菌ペニシリンとしては、ピペラシリン（商品名：ペントシリン）、ピペラシリン・タゾバクタム（商品名：ゾシン）が知られています。
	タゾバクタムはβ−ラクタマーゼ阻害薬です
	なお、あらゆる細菌に効果を示すわけではありません。
	例えば、ＭＲＳＡに対して抗緑膿菌ペニシリンは効果がありません。

	しかし、そうしたイメージは間違っている。
	そもそも過去の先進国の経済成長は、作業員１人１人がツルハシを持って仕事をしていた工事現場にブルドーザーやクレーンが登場したことから始まりました。
	まずメーカーが機械を発明し、それが市場に投入され、道路工事を請け負う企業がそれを購入し、工事に使用するという資本蓄積が起きる。
	そして、現場が機械を動かす技能を身につけることによってイノベーション（技術進歩）が起きる。

	マフラーとコートは冬の必須アイテムですが、コートを着てマフラーを巻いてとなると、どうしても重苦しい雰囲気になってしまいます。
	重苦しく見せない為にはマフラーとコートは同じ黒色にしない、ということも大切ですが、柄物のマフラーならなおＧＯＯＤです。
	特にこちらのコーディネートのように、マフラーを巻いた時に縦にラインができる柄の物なら細身に見える効果も期待できます。
	また、コートを前開けに着ても軽く見せる事ができます。

	キレカジファッションの移り変わり
	ここにきて新たなファッションに注目が来たと思われていますが、実はキレカジと
	いう言葉はずいぶん前からありました。
	９０年代前半には、渋カジからキレカジへ
	のファッションが派生しています。
	このころのキレカジ定番スタイルは、金ボタン付き
	の紺ブレ（ブレザー）にストレートジーンズという組み合わせでした。
	当時のテレビ
	ドラマの影響もあって、こぞって真似する人が増えましたね。

	ストリートファッションの歴史
	街中にいる若者たちの間で流行りだすことからストリートファッションと呼びますが、流行りには歴史があります。
	まず、８０年代はアメカジが流行っていた時代です。
	ストリートファッションの流行りは映画や音楽から影響受けることが多いので、当時
	後悔された映画などを見ると流行りが良くわかります。
	トップガンのヒットにより、
	ミリタリー色を取り入れるのも流行りました。
	９０年代になると今のストリート系により近くなります。
	スケーターズファッション、ダボダボのヒップホップファッションに身に包む人が増えました。
	２０００年代になると８０年代や９０年代のファッションが復活し始め、ファッションブランド
	でも率先してストリート系のアイテムをデザインするようになりました。

	まず定番なのが、テーラードジャケットです。
	黒のジャケットにジーンズを合わせたり、
	チノパンを合わせたりします。
	ジャケットの中に着るのもシャツにするかＶネックのカットソーにするかで、印象も変わってきますね。
	ジャケットを中心にコーディネートをアレンジしていくと、何パターンか組み合わせを
	作ることができます。
	ジャケットにシャツの組み合わせよりもっとカジュアルダウンしたいなら、ニットカー
	ディガンにシャツを組み合わせて、ブラックデニムや濃い目のジーンズを合わせます。
	靴はスニーカーでもいいのですが、キレイめを強調したいなら、レザーのショーツブーツ
	を合わせるのもオススメです。
	夏でキレカジファッションをしたいなら、ポロシャツが役に立ちます。
	襟が付いている
	だけでかなりキレイめ度がアップします。
	そのときのポロシャツは大きめサイズではなく、
	ジャストサイズで質の良いものがベストです。

	違い、おわかりいただけただろうか
	どうでしょう。
	おわかりいただけたでしょうか。
	そうです、違い、ほぼございません。
	しかし人生とは自己満足の追求にあると僕は考えております。
	こうやってツラツラ「マジでやめとけ」の言い換えを並べてきたけれども、自分がどこまで行けるをかをシビアに試し、一瞬の輝きに生のすべてをつぎ込むその姿にいまだにちょっと惹かれ憧れたりもします。
	その一瞬の輝きがあれば人間生きていた意味があったなと思えるのかもしれない。
	ステージの上のバンドは、本当に何物にも代えがたいカッコよさだし、名曲には価値のつけようもない。
	ただ、内情はみなさんの見ている表層とはだいぶ違ったりするよ。
	今回の記事はこれさえわかってくれれば大満足だ。
	それではまた、次の記事で！

	あと歌手とかアイドルとかのライブだったりレコーディングだったりをサポートするスタジオミュージシャン。
	あとゴーストライター。
	誰か自分以外の人が歌うために曲を作るのがコチラ側。
	最近では歌手が自分で曲を作ることがほとんどになってしまったため、基本的にアイドルの曲やアニソン、あとはＢＧＭとか後は編曲とかがメインの仕事になる。
	個人でやってくというよりも、作曲チームや、作曲、曲提供を生業にしている会社も結構あり、そっちに所属して企業戦士ライクにガシガシ機械的に曲を作るパターンの方が多いかも。

	？調べれば何とかなる英語、国語、社会に対して、理科、数学を質問できる環境は必須です。
	質問をしないことで、途中式や解き方の一部を分かったことにしたり暗記したりしてしまうことが学力の向上を大きく妨げます。
	最低でも大学院生または旧帝大レベルの学部生、できれば予備校講師に週に３回程度質問できる環境の確保が重要です。
	※大学院生や大学の学部生のなかでは、該当科目がもともと得意だった人よりも、努力して成果を出した人の方が教え方は優れています。
	また大学院生、大学生の場合、国語が得意な国立大受験経験の講師の方が教え方は優れています。

	※中高一貫校受験の方．．．自分の意志で行う受験経験がなく、勉強法や学習量に不安を持つ人が多いですが、逆に講師に相談して勉強を進める傾向があり、経験がないことが有利に働くケースがよくあります。
	欠点は英語の基礎を作る中３から高１の間で受験の壁を乗り越えていないこと。
	英語が伸び悩む傾向があります。
	※塾通いをせず高校受験をされた方．．．勉強法を確立している人が多く、塾や教材任せにする傾向がないため、大学受験で伸びるケースが良くあります。
	ただし予備校や塾の講師に勉強法を相談することは必要です。

	？【１】夜２２時ごろで勉強を打ち切ること
	後がない浪人生は不安からつい深夜まで勉強をしてしまいます。
	しかし２２時以降は人体の体内時計（時計遺伝子）が作動してリラックスモード（＝副交感神経優位）に自動的に入ります。
	この時間に机に向かっていると、脳は覚醒物質を出して作業を継続させようとします。
	わかりやすくいえばカフェイン入りのドリンク剤を飲みながら勉強をしているのに近い状況です。
	これは「偽の集中力」ということができ、実際の学力は伸びてこないことが多くなります。
	どんなに絶好調だと感じても必ず２２時には勉強を打ち切って、２３時の就寝を目指すことがカギになります。
	２３時に就寝すると６時頃に目が覚めやすくなります。
	なお休日の「寝だめ」は効果がないばかりか大きく調子を崩すことにつながります。
	少しゆっくりしたくても、＋２時間の睡眠（６時に起きる習慣がある人は、８時）が限度となります。

	？浪人し受験に失敗した人の多くが英語を得意科目にできなかった人です。
	英語は配点が高いから重要。
	これが受験生の理解ですが実際にはもう少し深い要素があります。
	それは英語が唯一の「真の積み重ね型の教科」ということです。
	地歴公民は中学校でも習いますが、高校では初めからもう一度習います。
	例えば日本史なら高校で改めて縄文時代から学び直します。
	理科も同様です。
	国語は中学のときに苦手科目であっても、高校から力を入れれば伸びてきます（漢検３級程度の基礎は必要）。
	数学は積み重ねの要素が多少ありますが、英語ほどではなく挽回が可能です。
	？一方英語は中３や高１で苦手教科だった場合には、浪人して人並み勉強をしても苦手が改善されない科目です。
	人の３倍程度勉強時間をとってもなお変化はありません。
	「真の積み重ね型の教科」である英語は、基礎が不十分な場合、スタート時の偏差値が５０ならずっと５０のまま、４５ならずっと４５のまま終わることが多い、逆転が難しい科目です。

	報告書内容の注意点
	１．内容に欠落がないか
	報告書においては、内容に欠落があっては、役に立ちません。
	まず、数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）、固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）、単位（千、万、円、ドル、グラム、Ｋｇ等）、相手の意志（反対する、賛成する、購入する、購入しない等）を報告書から漏らしてはいけません。
	読み手に「悟ってもらう」事はありえません。
	ビジネス文書では相手は、自分の文章を「最も批判的に読む」と考えるべきです。
	自分に都合良く、相手が解釈してくれることは絶対にありえません。
	報告書を書き上げたら、妥当かどうかを確認してください。
	２．内容に誤認がないか
	・数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）
	・固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）
	・単位（千、万、円、ドル等）
	・相手の意志（反対、賛成、購入する、購入しない等）
	を勝手に解釈して、事実誤認しないこと。
	誤認によって、今後の動きが違ってくる可能性があるので、事実を正確に把握することはきわめて重要です。
	これを防ぐには、メモを取るときに、重要だと思う点にサインをつけておき、商談・会議の終わりに再確認するのが望ましいと思います。

	ミントの苗選びのコツは、ひょろっと長いものよりも株元から何本も芽が出ている株を選びましょう。
	また地面の近くの下葉の裏をみて斑点状に変色していないものや虫が付いていないかも確認して下さい。
	植え付け時期はハーブ苗が出回る時期に合わせ、だいたい真冬と真夏は避ければいつでも大丈夫です。
	鉢選びと植え付けのコツ
	ミントは地植えと鉢植えの両方できますが生育旺盛で根も張るため植える鉢も大きめの鉢を選ぶ必要があります。
	目安として、市販されている黒いビニールポット３号ポット（直径９ｃｍ）に植えられている苗の場合５〜６号鉢（直径１８ｃｍ）くらいを選びましょう。
	植え付ける土は保湿性のあるハーブ専用培養土か肥料が配合されている野菜栽培用などの培養土を選んでください。
	ミントを植えるときに注意したいのは混植してはいけません。
	ミントは繁殖力が強いため一緒に植えてもミントだらけになってしまい他の植物を枯らしてしまいます。
	また、ミント同士でも種間交雑をしてしまうため１鉢１品種で栽培しましょう。
	水やりと肥料
	ミントは乾燥に弱いので鉢の表面が乾いたら鉢底から水が流れ出るまで水をあげて下さい。
	また肥料に関しては基本的に植え付け時に肥料入りの培養土で植え付けたのなら追肥はあまり必要ありません。
	葉色が黄色くなってきたり葉数を増やしたい場合は固形もしくは液体の肥料を肥料の容器に書かれている用法容量に従って与えて下さい。

	とゆったりしたニットやニットワンピをさらっと着ておでかけ。
	そんな姿も「ちょっとゆるくてカワイイ」と人気みたいです！仕事ではカチッとしたファッションなのに、休日はゆったりのギャップにやられちゃうという声も。

	『心配事の９割は起こらない』なんて本が話題になりましたが、実際アメリカで行われた研究の結果、「心配したことの“８５％”は、結局“いい結果”か“良くも悪くもない中立の結果”に終わる」んだとか。
	また、実際に心配事が現実になってしまった場合でも、約８割の人が「自分が想像していたよりも上手く出来事に対処できた！」と語っているそうです。
	「不安はそもそも現実にならないし、もしそうなっても何とかなる！」と科学的に証明されているのはなんだか心強いですね。
	心が押しつぶされてしまいそうな時は、ぜひこの結果を思い出してみて。

	≪パソコンからのメールを拒否≫
	発信元がパソコンのメール（携帯ではないメール）を、すべて受信拒否にします。
	ほぼすべての迷惑メールはパソコンから送信されているため、強力な迷惑メール対策になりますが、同時に迷惑メールではないパソコン経由のメールも届かなくなってしまいます。
	≪指定アドレス（ｏｒドメイン）受信≫
	こちらが指定したメールアドレス（ｏｒドメイン）は、必ず受信されます。
	≪指定アドレス（ｏｒドメイン）拒否≫
	こちらが指定したメールアドレス（ｏｒドメイン）は、必ず拒否されます。
	≪なりすまし拒否≫
	送信元と送信アドレスがちがう（携帯アドレスに見せかけてパソコンから送信するなど）メールは拒否します。
	上記４種類の設定を組み合わせることで、迷惑メールがｉＰｈｏｎｅに届く前にサーバで処理します。

	アドレス取得の手間はほとんどかかりませんし、保有数の制限は当然ないため、個人で複数のアドレスを持てます。
	これにより、用途や相手によりアドレスを使い分けることが可能になります。
	またいくらでも無料で手に入るため、不要なアドレスを使い捨てしても問題ありません。
	２．パソコンからも送受信できる
	パソコンで文字を打つのが得意な人にとっては、見逃せないメリット。
	パソコンのキーボードで素早く文字を打てます。
	またｉＰｈｏｎｅそのものが使えない状態でもメールが送受信できます。
	３．ｉＰｈｏｎｅアプリを使えば、携帯アドレスと同じように使える
	ブラウザでサービスにログインする必要はありません。
	専用のアプリを使うことで、携帯メールと同じように送受信できます。
	また「メール」アプリに、取得した無料アドレスのアカウントを追加することもできます。
	４．デフォルトの迷惑メール対策に期待できる
	Ｇｍａｉｌなど大手の無料メールは、強力な迷惑メールのフィルタリング機能を搭載しています。
	世界中のユーザーから集められた情報により、特別な設定をすることなく迷惑メールの可能性が高いものを排除してくれます。

	設問の流れとしては、消費者が商品を知ったきっかけ〜購入にいたるプロセス、購入後の満足度、今後の継続意向という順に聞くことが一般的です。
	回答者が思い起こしやすいよう、時系列をあわせる。
	また満足度については、先に総合満足度を聞き、その後に詳細満足度を聞くことがセオリーです。
	掘り下げていくような設問設計をする場合は、まずは総合的・一般的な質問をし、その後に詳細を聞くようにしましょう。
	※詳細満足度を先に聞くと、その内容が回答者の頭に入り総合満足度の結果が変わってしまう（バイアスがかかる）ことにつながります。

	上述した通り、おすすめは単一選択型（ＳＡ）です。
	単一選択型の場合、回答者は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	答えやすくなる理由は、「すでに用意された選択肢のなかから、どれかひとつを選ぶだけで済む」ためです。
	自由回答型（ＦＡ）の項目の場合、回答者はゼロから記載する内容を考えざるを得なくなるので、圧倒的に回答ハードルは高くなります。

	回答選択肢は対象者が選択しやすいように工夫し、「その他」を選択する人が少ないようにする必要があります。
	単一選択型だけでなく、選択肢型の選択肢を設計する際、回答できる選択肢が「もれなく」「ダブりなく」用意できるよう熟考しましょう。
	選択肢型設問で必須選択の場合、回答できる選択肢が網羅されているか
	→＜対策＞「その他＋フリーアンサー」や「特になし」「あてはまるものはない」など排他の択肢を入れておく。
	「その他」には企業側が思い付かなかった顧客の声が隠されていることがあるので、その内容を把握できるようフリーアンサーボックスを付けておくと良い。
	専門用語や一般的ではない業界用語・省略語などわかりにくい用語やあいまいな表現はないか
	→＜対策＞人によって理解が異なりそうな用語は、定義付けしておく
	設問に対する選択肢になっているか
	選択肢が漏れなく重複なく（ＭＥＣＥ）設計できているか
	回答が偏らないかなど

	アンケートには、「紙で行う場合」と「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行う場合」がありますが、弊社では、回答者がネット環境に接続できない理由がある（たとえばターゲットが高齢者のみの場合など）といった特殊なケース以外では、「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行うアンケート」をおすすめしています。
	アンケートの作成・データ収集・集計など、アンケート業務のほとんどのプロセスにおいて、業務を効率化できコストダウンも図れるためです。
	たとえば、弊社のクラウドサービスＳｙｎｅｒｇｙ！３６０の場合、回答内容によって異なる設問（ページ）へフォームを分岐できるので、Ｗｅｂフォームを活用すれば回答者の負担軽減も可能になり、回答率の向上が図れます。
	「問１にＡと回答した人は問３のページへ飛ぶ、Ｂと回答した人は問５のページへ飛ぶ」のような「設問の条件分岐」の設定が簡単に実現できます。

	３答えやすい質問・内容になればなるほど、回答率は上がる
	答えやすいアンケートを作成するために、「ターゲット」に合わせた口調で調査票の文章を設計しましょう。
	ポイントは、「わかりやすい文章」「ターゲット」「専門用語」「対象」「時期」「回答形式（単一選択型）」です。
	「わかりやすい文章」で質問文を書く
	意識的に、一文の長さを短めに設計すると端的でわかりやすくなります。
	また、「ターゲット」が取引先のお客様であれば、その業界に特有の「専門用語」などは通じますが、一般消費者がターゲットの場合は平易な日本語に置き換える、など工夫も必要です。
	「対象（誰、どこ、何についての質問なのか）」について明確にする
	「時期（過去・現在・未来）」を明確にする
	「回答形式」は「単一選択型」がおすすめ
	単一選択型の回答形式は、回答する側は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	回答形式については、詳細を後述します。

	他にも、顔にむくみがある場合は腎臓や心臓疾患、顔色が悪くめまいがする場合は貧血や更年期障害、低血圧症のおそれがあります。
	更年期障害の場合は、閉経の前後に女性ホルモンのバランスの変化により、だるさや疲れ、不眠などの症状が出ます。
	さらに大きな病気の前触れとして、うつ病や心身症などの精神疾患や、慢性肝炎や肝硬変などの肝臓の疾患、胃がん、大腸がん、糖尿病、結核、慢性腎盂腎炎などの症状としてだるさや倦怠感が現れることもあります。
	疲労からなりやすいと言われるうつ病は、特別な疾患はないにも関わらず、だるさが続き、気力が低下したり、落ち込むことがあります。
	だるさや倦怠感を感じた場合、まず休養を取ることが大切ですが、なかなか回復しない場合は他の病気の可能性はないかと疑うことも必要です。

	体にウイルスなどの敵が侵入すると、白血球内のリンパ球に存在する免疫細胞が、攻撃をしかけて撃退します。
	このときに抗体を作り、再び同じ敵が侵入してきたときのために備えます。
	この抗体が「ＩｇＥ抗体」と呼ばれるもので、花粉を敵と勘違いして、花粉に接触する度に「ＩｇＥ抗体」が作られて体内に蓄積され、ある水準を超えると花粉症として発症します。
	また、免疫細胞である「Ｔｈ１細胞」と「Ｔｈ２細胞」も、花粉症を発生させる原因のひとつといわれています。
	その仕組みは、アレルギー反応を促す「Ｔｈ２細胞」と、それを見張ってアレルギー反応を抑える「Ｔｈ１細胞」のバランスが崩れることで、花粉症などのアレルギーが発症するというものです。

	内科の病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感
	内科の病気の症状が現れる前に、疲労感が現れることもあります。
	時間が経つとそれぞれの病気が持つ特徴的な症状が現れますが、それまでの病気がまだ分かっていない間に疲労感は現れます。
	精神的なストレスの蓄積や過労、睡眠不足、心配事などが原因で、軽いうつ病の症状として疲労感を感じることがあります。
	また、自律神経障害の症状として疲労感が生じることもあります。
	また、立ち仕事やパソコン業務の長時間労働などにより肉体的な疲労感を感じることもあります。
	同じ姿勢で長時間いることで一部の筋肉しか使われず、特定の筋肉のこりを生じやすいからです。
	筋肉のこりは肩や首、頭部にかけて生じることが多いため、頭痛やめまい、目の奥が痛むなどの症状が現れることがあります。
	他にも、睡眠時無呼吸症候群や慢性疲労症候群、潜在的ビタミンＢ１欠乏症、糖尿病などの病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感もあります。
	回復しないだるさや倦怠感がある場合は、重大な病気が潜んでいることもあるので、病院で診てもらう必要があります。
	また、定期的に人間ドッグなどの健康診断を受けることも大切です。

	花粉症の改善に効果が期待できるとして注目される代表的な乳酸菌とビフィズス菌には、以下のようなものがあります。
	●フェカリス菌
	加熱殺菌して死滅した状態で摂取しても高い効果が得られる新型乳酸菌。
	スギ花粉症患者２０名に曝露（ばくろ）室で人工的に一定量の花粉を浴びてもらい、その後、フェカリス菌入り乳性飲料を１日１本２か月間飲用後にも同じ実験を実施。
	飲む前と後では、鼻かみ回数や目のかゆみなどが減り、アレルギー症状が改善する傾向が認められました。
	●Ｌ−９２乳酸菌
	花粉症にかかった人を対象に、一定期間にわたってＬ−９２乳酸菌を摂取してもらったところ、
	アレルギーの原因となる「Ｔｈ２細胞」を活性化する物質が抑えられました。
	その結果、花粉症の改善に効果があることが立証されました。
	●ＫＷ乳酸菌
	花粉症患者９６人にＫＷ乳酸菌の粉末を摂取してもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善。
	また、マウスによる実験において、血中のＩｇＥ濃度が低下し、Ｔｈ２細胞とＴｈ１細胞のバランスが改善されたことも報告されています。
	●ビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６
	スギ花粉が飛び始める約１か月前から１３週間にわたって、花粉症患者４４名にビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６粉末を飲んでもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善されたという実験結果が報告されています。
	以上は代表的なものですが、今後もさらに注目の新しい菌が発見される可能性もあります。

	実はブラックとネイビー無地は悪い意味でシンプルになりがちです。
	スーツスタイルのコーディネート配色のポイントの１つがコントラストをつけすぎないことです。
	グレーに比べブラックやネイビーはコーディネートでよく使われる白シャツとのコントラストが強まり、フォーマル寄りのイメージが強まります。
	するとシンプルなイメージが強まり、毎回同じコーディネートに見られたり地味な印象を受けられやすくなります。
	そのため就活生っぽく見えてしまったり、素材の良し悪しの影響やコーディネートが似た印象になり、いまいちパッとしないイメージになりがちです。
	抽象的ですがビジネスシーンではフォーマルすぎないバランスが大事になってきます。
	そのフォーマルすぎないバランスを取れる色がグレー系と柄ありのネイビーになるのです。
	白シャツと合わせてもコントラストが低いので、良い意味で自然にぼやけてくれてネクタイの合わせやすさや優しい印象に繋がります。
	コーディネートのしやすさと地味すぎない適度な華やかさを考慮すると上の３種類に定まってきます。
	生地は基本的にウール１００％で探すのをオススメします。

	無地
	そのままの意味で柄無しの無地です。
	最もフォーマルで何も影響しないためコーディネートも組み立てやすいです。
	ただしシンプルなだけに選ぶ際は色々と注意も必要です。
	まず無地だと生地自体がごまかしがきかないため、生地の良し悪しがダイレクトに伝わってきます。
	これはファッションに興味のない人でもすぐにわかります。
	できればウール１００％かそれに近いウール混率を選ぶとツヤ感や風合いにチープ感がなくなり全体の印象もぐっとレベルアップします。
	普通に着こなしているつもりなのになぜか就活生っぽく感じてしまうのもこのことが原因です。
	ではウール１００％であれば問題ないのかと言われると必ずしもそうとは言えません。
	詳しくは後述しますが、働くためにスーツを着ているのですから、ビジネスシーンににおいてはスーツ自体の強度も重要になる人も多いはず。
	そのためにはポリエステル混の方が生地自体の強さという点では優れているのです。
	無地を選ぶ際は、必ずという訳ではないですが出来れば、生地自体の見た目とポリエステルの混率にも注意してみるのがお勧めです。
	ストライプ
	スーツ以外でも非常に多く使われる、上から下へ直線が等間隔で並んでいる柄です。
	ピッチ（間隔）によって印象が変わります。
	ピッチが太いと華やかで主張のある貫禄ある印象に、細いとシャープにフォーマル寄りになります。

	プレゼント予算としては、人数などにもよりますが、お１人３千円〜５千円×５人〜１０人といったところでしょうか。
	ちょっと話しは違いますが、奥様が旦那様を旦那様が奥様を祝ってあげられる方もいらっしゃいます。
	そんなご注文を見るたびに素敵なご夫婦だなってつい微笑んでしまいします。
	自分の大切な人を祝うことが出来るのも還暦祝いのいいところですね。

	皆さん気になるところですよね。
	プレゼントのご予算の相場は、還暦祝い本舗調べでは、２万円前後です。
	会食費や、旅行代が親御様一人につき１〜２万円程度がそれに加わっているようです。
	プレゼント２万円＋ご両親会食代ｏｒ旅行代２〜３万円＝５万円前後あくまで目安なので、ご兄弟の人数やお祝いの方法によってご予算は変わってきますので、お祝いされる皆さんでご旅行など金額が大きくなるときは、事前に積み立てをされるのもいいですね。
	一緒にお祝いされる方とお祝い方法も含めてよくご相談しましょう。

	明治の頃までは年齢は数え年で表していて、生れた時が１歳で始まり、年が明けると誕生日と関係なく２歳になる数え方をしてました。
	ですので、「満年齢で６０歳の誕生日」の年が「数え年の６１歳」になります。
	ちょっと注意したいのは、その年の１月１日から１２月３１日までが、数え年の６１歳なんですね。
	満年齢が一般的な現在では違和感はありますが、年が明けたお正月には数え年で６１歳の誕生年？になるので、お正月から節分（立春）の頃までにお祝いを済ませていたようです。
	現在は満年齢が一般的になっているため、６０歳を迎える誕生日にお祝いをされるのが一般的になってきています。

	具体例で見ておきましょう。
	トヨタの株価が７５００円、スズキの株価が４０００円とします。
	株価収益率はトヨタが１０倍、スズキが１７倍になっています。
	トヨタの株価はトヨタ１年分の１株純利益の１０年分、スズキは１７年分ですので、スズキのほうが投資家の人気・期待が高く割高と言えます。

	株価とは、一株当たりの価格のことです。
	市場で売り手と買い手が取引のたびに合意した価格です。
	株価はその企業の現在から将来にわたる見通しを反映しています。
	その見通しは投資家の間で刻々と変化していきますので、株価もこれに連動して常に変動します。
	ここが株価の見方を難しくしているのですが、原理はリンゴ１個、ミカン１個の価格と同じです。

	インターネットの株価欄の活用法
	インターネットサイトの利点は、今現在の株価がすぐに分かることに加えて、以下の３つがあります。
	●タイムリーな株価に基づいて、株式時価総額、株価収益率、株価純資産倍率が自動計算されている
	●タイムリーな株価に基づいてさまざまなチャートを自由に利用できる
	●銘柄に関連するニュースをすばやく知ることができる
	株式市場を俯瞰的に見るには新聞にも利点がありますが、既に気になる銘柄があって、それを追いかけるならインターネットの株価欄はお勧めです。
	ちなみに、多くのサイトでは無料で利用できるサービスだけでも株式投資で必要なほとんどの情報をカバーできます。
	より詳しい情報を知りたい方には、証券会社のインターネットサイトがおすすめです。

	株価の見方は難しいと感じることはありませんか。
	株式を始めたばかりの方だけではありません。
	投資経験を積んできた方も、時として直面する投資家共通の悩みです。
	実は株価の見方は非常に単純で、株価が割高か割安かさえ押さえれば判断を誤ることがありません。
	株価の見方で迷っている投資家の方は、いつの間にかこの基本を忘れてしまっているケースがほとんどです。
	そんな時は、今の株価が割安なのか割高なのか、なるべくシンプルに整理することが投資で成功する近道です。
	これまで見てきた成功した投資家の多くも、要所要所でこうアプローチしてきました。
	私の長年の投資経験からも同じ結論になります。
	そこで、株価を正しく見る視点、株価の意味と情報の読み取り方を身につけて、適切な投資判断につなげていきましょう。
	ざっくりいうと
	「株価の高低」と「時価総額の大小」の違いを明確に理解できるようになることが投資家への第一歩です。
	「株価の高低」と「株価の割高・割安」の違いをおさえることが、投資判断をする上でこの上なく重要です。

	・ソフトウェアのアップデートが累積している場合
	ＷｉｎｄｏｗｓＵｐｄａｔｅ、ＡｐｐＳｔｏｒｅのソフトウェアアップデート、Ａｄｏｂｅ製品のアップデート、ＪａｖａＵｐｄａｔｅのような「更新」が累積していると、インターネットに接続したときにまとめてアップデートが実行され、画面表示がまったく追いつかなくなることがあります。
	この場合も気長に待つことになります。
	また更新の際には、ハードディスクの動作ランプが激しく明滅しますので、判断のポイントになります。
	根本的な対処方法として、パソコンをこれまでよりたくさん起動する、アップデート情報に敏感になるなどの意識が必要です。
	これらのソフトはインターネットで個別に「手動アップデート」をすることもできますので、これを利用するのもよいでしょう。

	パソコンの起動が途中で止まる場合、問題がない場合とある場合があります。
	Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓパソコンで起動中に真っ暗な画面がしばらく続く場合、多くは「何も問題はない」といえます。
	パソコン本体を見ると、ハードディスクの動作を示すランプがちかちか不規則に点滅しているはずです。
	場合によっては起動ができるまで辛抱強く待ちましょう。
	ただし、毎回起動時に真っ黒画面が続くようであれば異常が考えられますので、専門家にご相談ください。
	一方で問題が発生している場合は、コンピューターはどんな異常が発生しているのかを利用者に知らせるようにできています。
	これには、画面が真っ青になって（ブルースクリーンといいます）英語で異常報告が行われる場合と、黒い画面に異常報告がおこなわれる場合があります。
	これらの異常報告画面が表示されたときには、専門家でない限り、手出しはしない方がよいでしょう。
	可能ならば異常報告画面を記録しておき、メーカーやお店のサポートいった専門家に相談しましょう。
