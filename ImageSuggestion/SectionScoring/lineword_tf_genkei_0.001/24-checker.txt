	二日酔いしにくいお酒の種類
	お酒はその分類方法によって、二日酔いしやすいお酒と二日酔いしにくいお酒に分けることができます。
	この分類はお酒の性質とその作られ方に依存します。
	ここでは二日酔いを予防、防止するために、二日酔いしやすいお酒について、その種類となぜ二日酔いしやすいのかについて紹介しています。

	醸造酒を避け、蒸留酒を飲む
	醸造酒を避け、蒸留酒を飲む蒸留酒は醸造酒（のような原液）を沸騰させ、アルコール分を高め不純物を取り除いたお酒です。
	蒸留酒の方が不純物が少ないため、二日酔いになりにくくなっています。

	安いお酒を避け、高いお酒を飲む
	お酒の値段は非常に重要な二日酔いの指標になります。
	理由は値段が高いほどより不純物を取り除く（メタノールを含む）作業が多く行われているからです。
	同じ蒸留酒であっても高いお酒を飲むほうが二日酔いしにくく体にも優しくなります。
	同じお酒でもメーカーなどによっても成分は異なる
	同じ値段のビールであってもＡ社だと二日酔いしないがＳ社だと二日酔いしやすい、とうい現象はよくあることです。

	不純物入りを避ける
	ある実験で赤ワインと白ワインを飲んだグループを比較した所、赤ワインを飲んだグループの方が血中セントロニン、ヒスタミンの濃度が高く、二日酔いによる頭痛の程度が激しかったという結果が出ました。
	これはアルコールに含まれる不純物の量による違いです。
	意外ですが、ウォッカはアルコール濃度の割りには二日酔いしにくくなっています。
	ウォッカはバーボンの１／３７の不純物しか含まれません。
	メタノール含有は避ける
	メタノール含有は避けるウィスキーやブランデーといった風味が強く独特のクセのある蒸留酒やワインなどの果実酒には、微量のメタノールが含まれています。
	これらメタノールは通常のアルコールと比較すると身体に長く留まります。
	理由はエタノールの分解がメタノールにより阻害されることと、メタノールは分解に非常に長い時間がかかるためです。
	その結果、翌朝以降もお酒が残ってしまい二日酔いの症状が長引く原因となります。
	また、メタノールそのものが有毒であり、少量であっても頭痛、めまい、吐き気の原因になります。
	同じビールであっても柑橘系のビールだと二日酔いしやすいなどはこのメタノールが原因かもしれません。
	メタノールが原因の二日酔いについてはメタノールが原因の二日酔い対策をご参照下さい。
