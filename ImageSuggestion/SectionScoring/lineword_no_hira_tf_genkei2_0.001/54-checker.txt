	ギターのパンの振り方
	はい、ギターなんですが、ステージ上は「上手（かみて）」「下手（しもて）」という風にツインギターで分かれるのが基本です。
	で、ボーカルギターだったり、ギターが一人だったりするパターンも、もちろんあります。
	では、ＣＤなどの音源に収録する場合はギターはどうすれば良いのか？という話ですが、上記のパターンを無視して左右に振るのが安定です。
	具体的には、以下のような例が良いと思います。

	ボーカル・コーラスのパンの振り方
	ボーカルなんですが一番自由なんじゃないかと勝手に考えています。
	が、冒険しすぎても痛い目にあいますので、まずは基本から。
	主旋律は中央
	コーラスは中央でも良いし、複数レコーディングしてＲとＬに３０くらい振って広がりを持たせても良い
	特殊効果を狙ってＲ（Ｌ）６０とかに飛ばすのもありだけど、無理しない
	コーラスは広がりと厚みを持たせる効果がありますので、左右にちょっとだけ振るというのと、同じハモリを２回録って両側に広げるか、１回録ったのを複製して左右に振る（ダブリング）のが良いでしょう。
	またパンの話ではありませんが、主旋律を食わないようにコーラスの音量は主旋律より小さめ（７割くらい）に設定して下さい。
	おわりに
	いかがでしたでしょうか。
	音源に収録する場合、多くはステージ上の立ち位置を意識しますが、一方で音響特性に配慮した振り方をしなければなりません。
	その一例がベースとバスドラムの中央徹底であったり、スリーピース編成でもギターを多重録音して左右に振ることだったりします。
	よく「スリーピースとは思えない音圧」みたいな評価を耳にしますが実際複数ギターが有るんだから当たり前です。
	デジタルレコーディングならではのからくりが存在します。
	意外と詳細に説明されていない「きほんのき」的なパンの振り方、まずはこれを押さえてから、ご自身のオリジナリティを発揮されるのがクリエイティブで良いかと思います。

	ハイハットは左（Ｌ８０〜９０くらい）か右（Ｒ８０〜９０）、お好みで。
	中央でも良い
	ライドシンバルはハイハットの逆、若干内側（ハイハットがＬ８０だとしたら、ライドはＲ６０みたいな）
	クラッシュシンバルは２つあるはずなのでそれぞれ左右に振る（７０くらい？）
	タムはハイタムからフロアタムに向かってハイハットのパンの位置から反対側に向かって置いていくハイハットがＬ８０だとしたら、ハイタムがＬ５０、フロアタムがＲ３０みたいな
	スプラッシュシンバルやチャイナシンバルはキットの位置から連想してお好みで、中央でも良い
	基本的な考え方はドラマーを中心としてハイハットが左にあるか、観客を中心にしてハイハットが右にあるかどうかを想像した上で、ドラムキットのキットピースの位置関係を再現するように振ることです。
	例外としてスネアとバスは常に中央に置きます。
	この位置関係を考えると、ハイハットが左右にあって、タムがそこから反対側に流れていくことや、クラッシュシンバルを左右に振る理由がわかると思います。
	ただし、メジャーなアーティストの音源だとハイハットが中央にあるのも結構主流ですので、「聴いてみて良かった感じ」をご自身で判断するのが良いでしょう。

	基本的に私は、ステージに立っている時の見た目に合わせてパンを配置します。
	しかし、例えばドラムなどは実際にステージで見たならばほとんどステレオ感はありませんが、ミックスになるとかなり広めに広がる事も多い楽器です。
	ですので、その辺りの事情も考慮した配置になります。
	例を挙げるならば、上手側にギターがいる場合、そのギターとハイハットが被らないようにする。
	下手も同じでギターがいる場合は、クラッシュやライドがギターに被さらない様にします。
	フロアタムなども意外とギターと被ってしまう事に注意です。
	また、ピアノとオルガンやシンセは、１人の奏者がステージ上では演奏するため同時に鳴る事は少ないのですが、ミックスでは重なる事も多々あり、同じパン振りから出す事はまずありません。
	これも例えてみるならば、ピアノが右３０くらいの場所にいるならば、オルガンが同時になる時は左３０から出す、といった具合です。
	また、シンセはソロの場合ですともちろんセンターが非常に多くなりますし、パッド系ならばミックス全体の邪魔にならない様に注意しながらも思いっきり広げる事がよくあります。
	シンセストリングスも同じで、完全に広げ過ぎるとミックスをぼやかしてしまいますが、あまりにステレオ感が狭いとせっかくのストリングスが持つ壮大さなどのイメージを発揮できません。
	ドラムとパーカッションがどちらも入っている時はその配置に特に注意しないといけません。
	７月に行ったバンドのレコーディングではちょうどリズム楽器両方が入ったものでした。
	更には、パーカッションも多種多様なものでしたので、パン振りにはかなり神経を遣いました。
	この時は、ステージ上で上手後方にパーカッションの方がいらっしゃるバンドだったため、ミックスでもその位置をベーシックに楽器によって左右に広げたり振ったりしてみました。

	２番めの「４回レコーディングする」というのはメタルで「ギターの壁」と呼ばれるような物凄い音圧のオケを作る場合に有効な手段です。
	バンドサウンドは「隙間の美学」みたいなところがあるので、原則として２本で問題ありません。
	リードギターをかぶせる場合は、３番目のように「バッキングが切れてオケがスカスカにならないように、バッキングの上にリードを重ねる」のが有効です。
	上記の例ではＲに振ろうとしていますが、下手がリードギター担当だった場合はＬでも良いでしょう。
	ボーカルがリードを弾くというパターン（凛として時雨のＴＫとか、チルボドのアレキシのような）も、聴いたときボーカルと団子にならないように左右に振るのが個人的にはおすすめです。
	バンド音源の場合、ステレオ的に左右に隙間ができやすいので、歪んだギターでもアコギでも左右に飛ばして広がりと音圧を稼ぐのが安定です。
	そういう意味で上記のような例を挙げてみました。
	ベースのパンの振り方
	ベースは簡単です。
	何も考えないで真ん中（Ｃｕｂａｓｅの表示だと「Ｃ」）で良いです。
	「ベースってバンドだと左にいるじゃん？」と思うかもしれませんが、必ず中央に置いてください。
	一般に「低音域は定位感が薄い」と言われていて、超低音は人間の耳にはどこから聴こえているのか判別しにくいそうです。
	ベースはもっといろんな倍音を含みますのでそうではないのですが、ベースを左右に飛ばしまくってる音源なんてそうそう存在しないのは音楽好きな皆様ならよくわかるかと思いますので、余計な冒険をしないのが懸命です。
	ドラムスのパンの振り方
	はい、ドラムが一番シビアというかめんどくさいです。
	なぜならばキットピースによって定位が異なるからです。
	つまり、バスドラムはここ、スネアはここ、ハイハットはここ、みたいな個別の配置が必要になります。
	それはなぜか？一般的にはオケに広がりを持たせるためとかドラムスのキットが一箇所にまとまっているわけではないのを表現するためと言われています。
	個人的には全部中央においたらごっちゃりしすぎて音圧稼げないからという説を推してみます。
	とりあえず、基本は以下を守れば問題ないと思います。

	例えば、ロックのドラムなどではあまりパンを広げ過ぎると、確かにシンバルが広くなって豪快に聴こえるようですが、少しセンターと左右のスピーカーの真ん中辺りに穴が目立ってしまったりすることもあります。
	中抜けなイメージですよね。
	逆に、広がりのある音数の多い楽曲でエレピの伴奏をステレオ録音して、そのパンを放置していたら、ミックス全体がごちゃごちゃしてしまったりもします。
	では、どの様なパン振りをしたらいいのでしょうか？？
	まず、基本的にはキックとスネア、ベース、ボーカルはセンターに定位している事が多いと言えます。
	もちろん、ドラムを全て片方のチャンネルに振り切ってしまう、ビートルズが試していたようなミックスもありますが、ここではオーソドックスなパンについて説明していきます。
	それではセンターに位置するもの以外の楽器はどの様に配置していくのがいいのでしょうか？

	また、８月末に行われた鎌倉音楽祭のライブレコーディングでは、キック・スネア・ハイハットのベーシックな３点とシンバル類、コンガ３つ、ジャンべ、カホン、そして鳴り物類多数という相当な数の編成でした。
	この時、キックは中心に、しかしスネアはセンターから少しずらす事でボーカルとのマスキングを少し抑え、ハットと他のパーカッション類は右手奥で鳴らして、カホンのみ例外で曲により中心やパーカッションと同じ場所、時には左手側に配置したものもあります。
	ＴｏｋｙｏＦＭで今月５日に１時間だけダイジェストで放送されたのですが、番組枠を拡大して再放送の話などもちらほらと聞きますので、もしも放送される事になりましたら是非聴いてみてください。
	聴いて頂くと、ライブレコーディングのミックスで私がいかに苦戦したかが分かると思います（笑）
	他、ＴＯＫＹＯＭＸテレビやＮＴＴぷらら、ＢＳＴｗｅｌｌＶなどでも放送が決まっておりますので、どこかで機会があったらチェックしてみてください。
	是非、その際はテレビの出力をスピーカーに出してパンを確認してください！！
	話が逸れましたが、もうひとつだけ例を挙げてみましょう。
	アコギ弾き語りのアーティストさんがいらっしゃったとして、アコギをラインで１本、ボーカル１本の両方をセンターからモノで出したとします。
	これはかなりＥＱとコンプでアコギを犠牲にしないといけなくなるはずです。
	しかし、センターから少しでもアコギをずらしてあげたり、マイク２本で録っているならば少しステレオで広げてアコギの中心をボーカルのあるセンターからずらしてあげる事で一気に解決できるはずです。
