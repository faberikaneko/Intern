	痛みが少ない。
	または感じない場合が多い
	出力はそれほど高くないので医療脱毛より火傷のリスクが低い
	料金は月額制など様々な支払い方法がある
	サロンなので入るのも恥ずかしくない
	店舗が沢山展開されていて通いやすい
	完了までの期間が早さに関しては医療脱毛にはかないませんが、デメリットを考えると、まずはサロン脱毛に通うことをオススメできます。

	※思いこみを認識する作業は、心の痛みを伴う場合があります。
	つらい過去を蒸し返すこともあるかもしれません。
	それでも痛みを直視し、客観的に分析する勇気をもたなければ、自分を苦しめている思いこみは明らかになりません。
	紙やパソコンに書きましょう。
	（書くと認識しやすくなります）
	そして、自分がピンときて納得できるまで根気よく、くりかえましょう。
	思いこみが特定できれば、悩みの半分以上を解決したも同然です。
	それでは次に紹介する５つの方法で、悩みを「無効化」していきましょう。

	これ以上マイナス金利になれば、個人が銀行に預ける預金がマイナス金利になったり、海外のように口座管理手数料が発生したり、する可能性もあるのです。
	当然、こうなれば家計への影響は絶大であり、さらに消費を冷え込ませる要因にもなりかねないのです。
	・マイナス金利拡大を日銀が推し進めざるをえない理由
	国債買入れの量的緩和も限界。
	うち手がない
	マイナス金利を導入する前から、物価目標を達成するために、国債を日銀が買い取ることで市場に出回るお金を増やしてインフレ誘導をしてきたのです。
	しかし、円高・株安という流れには抗えずに、結果が全然ついてこないという状況があり、マイナス金利を導入したのです。
	国債を買い取る予算にも限界がありますし、効果もほとんど発揮しないことが証明されてしまったため、国債買入れは続けると明言されているものの、限界に達していることは明らかなのです。
	そのため、マイナス金利拡大も視野に入れているのです。

	または感じない場合が多い
	出力はそれほど高くないので医療脱毛より火傷のリスクが低い
	料金は月額制など様々な支払い方法がある
	サロンなので入るのも恥ずかしくない
	店舗が沢山展開されていて通いやすい
	完了までの期間が早さに関しては医療脱毛にはかないませんが、デメリットを考えると、まずはサロン脱毛に通うことをオススメできます。

	ひどくなった場合は病院に行きましょう。
	自宅での対策は、刺激を与えないことが重要です。
	背中などはシャンプーカスが残ったりすることがあるので要注意です。
	また、ゴシゴシ洗いもＮＧなので、優しく洗うようにしましょう。

	例えば、通い始めて、耐えられない痛みを感じた場合、まぁいいやで済ませれない金額を支払います。
	こうなると後悔してしまいますよね。
	なので、まずは脱毛がどれくらいの刺激なのか感じるためにも光脱毛から通うのが理想的です。
	サロン脱毛の月額制の場合は、習い事のような感覚で月ごとに一定額の支払いです。
	更に、いつでも辞めることができます。
	なので、一定期間、光脱毛に通っても効果を感じられなかった場合に医療脱毛を検討するのがオススメです。
	しかし、「光脱毛を選択して良かった」と多くの方が効果を実感されています。
	まずは光脱毛をやってみようという気持ちで始めたとしても、きっと満足していただけると思いますよ♪

	信頼のできる実績あるサロンを選択しましょう。
	大手サロンは実績・経験共に豊富のためオススメです。
	また、レーザー脱毛の方が出力が高い機械を使用するため火傷のリスクが高くなります。
	まずは、サロンの光脱毛から始めるのがオススメです。
	安全性が高いと言っても熱を利用した施術なので火傷のリスクがゼロとは言えません。
	このことを頭において、信頼できるサロンを選ぶのがポイントです。

	看護基準は診療報酬に関係します。
	要は看護師を採用する方が病院は診療報酬が高めになります。
	こういった理由も加味され准看護師と看護師では職場に違いが出てくるのです。

	しかし、実際の業務は同じようなことをしている。
	また、看護師であれば管理職に就くことも出来ますので、さらに給料をアップさせることも可能です。
	こうした待遇の違いから、看護師を目指される准看護師の方もたくさんおられます。

	「多くの企業が中高年の活用を始めており、採用の難易度も改善されてきています。資格はあるのに雇ってくれる会社がない状況だった施工管理技士など、現場に欠かせない人材を順調に採用できるようになった企業も増えてきました」
	こうした流れが循環していけば、「金はいいから休みが欲しい」という現場の声にも応えていけるようになる。
	「飲食店でパート・アルバイトのシフトを回すように、大人数を抱えて適正な業務量で現場を動かしていくことが可能になれば離職防止にもなります」
	ここ数年来、賃金上昇によって人材募集を続けてきた状況は早期に落ち着くのではないか、と香月氏は予測している。
	「円安による資材高騰も影響もあるので一概には言えませんが、建築費高騰の主要因である人件費については高止まりの気配が見えてきていますね」
	かつての高待遇による一様な採用戦略ではなく、時限的に活用できる中高年の採用で光が見えてきた建設業界の人材難。
	建築費高騰が抑制され、新規物件の着工が検討しやすくなるようになる潮目の時期は意外と近いのかもしれない。
	新築を検討している場合、増税前（建築費は高騰）に動く方が賢いのか、増税後（建築費は抑制）の方が賢いのか．．．．．．しっかり検証し、投資戦略を立てる必要がありそうだ。

	若年層ではなく中高年層が働き手として求められている
	人材難の大きな要因は、これまで現場の中心であった２０〜３０代の若年層が建設業界の仕事に足を踏み入れることをためらっているからだという。
	「現状の忙しさは皆分かっているし、その要因がオリンピックに向けた大きな流れの中であることも分かっているので、“待遇が安定しているのは今だけ”と考える人が多いようです。確かに資格取得や技能経験を積んでも、５年後に仕事がなくなる可能性があるようでは躊躇してしまいますよね」
	そのため、香月さんが担当するクライアントの中では４０代〜５０代をターゲットに採用活動の方針転換を進めている企業も多いという。
	「２０２０年以降も安定した受注が見込める理由をアピールして、定年まで働きたいと考える中高年を狙っている求人が増えています。また大手ゼネコンでは定年した従業員を再雇用する動きも進んでいます。自社の業務への理解が深く、年齢的に働ける期間は需要がピークとなる向こう数年間だけ。企業と働く人双方にとってメリットがあるやり方だと思いますね」
	新規着工を検討できる潮目の時期は近い？

	種の識別は動物の場合には個体の形態に差があることで行われる。
	雌雄は形態差があっても同種である。
	どの程度の差があると別種とするのかは経験によってなされていることが多く普遍的な原則はない。
	ただし形態差の程度は生殖隔離の差に応じて違っている場合が多いと考えられている。
	繁殖可能な子が生まれるようであれば同種である。
	異なる種を交配して生まれた種は不妊である。
	例えばライオンとジャガーを交配して生まれたライガーには子供ができない。
	したがってライオンとジャガーは別種とする。
	ゲノム分析が可能になってゲノム差が大きく形態差がなくても別種とすべき隠蔽種の発見もある。
	【学名について】種名が国や地域言語によって異なっていては不都合である。
	生物種には世界共通の学名（ｓｃｉｅｎｔｉｆｉｃｎａｍｅ）がつけられている。

	進化の歴史を反映した自然分類のためには生物の外部形態ばかりでなく内部形態発生様式や生活環化石などを比較して形質を総合的に考えることが必要である。
	●第２項分類の方法
	アリストテレスの分類は１８世紀まで使われたが新しい生物の発見があいつぐとこの枠に入りきれないものも多くなった。
	またはじめのうち生物は慣用名でよばれたがちがった生物を同じ慣用名でよんだり分類と関連のない不適当な名前もあって分類学は混乱していた。
	【分類学の父】分類学の父といわれるリンネは『自然の体系』（１７３５年）の中で種の概念を確立し種が生物分類の基本的単位であると述べた。

	その辺りのソフトと親しくなりたい場合は覚えておくと良いかもしれない。
	あとは企業で利用されているケースが目立つので、覚えておけば仕事を得る手助けになる。
	けど、言語としてはだいぶ古いし、なんとか０ｘほどではないにしても新しいバージョンの仕様がなかなか決まらないし（クロージャ入れると言い始めてはや何年？）、モダンなものを求めてしまう人には向かないかもしれない。

	おわりに
	どの食用油でも、基本的には同じことがいえます。
	ただ、油は少量でも高カロリーなので、摂取のし過ぎには注意しましょう。
	また、私たちが普段料理に使っている量も実は摂取のし過ぎということも多いので、自分の食事を一度見直してみるのはいかがでしょうか。

	農地の査定について
	後で述べるように、農地を農地のまま売買する場合は、農業関連機関を介して行うか、個人間で売買することが多くなっています。
	不動産会社も上記の通り、手数料が安い上に買い手が限られ、さらに手間も多いとなれば、積極的に取り扱いたい案件ではないでしょう。
	ただ、転用を前提とすれば話は違います。
	農地は一般的に広大であるため、場所によってはそのような広大な土地を探すことも難しく、マンション需要などで求められることがあります。
	（実際、私の実家の近くでは、１年ほど前に遊休農地にマンションが建ちました）
	農地売買に必要な手続きと手数料
	農地売買では、農地として売るか農地以外で売るかによって必要な手続きは異なり、いずれにしても農業委員会から許可を得なくてはなりません。
	どちらも売買の流れとして大きく変わりないですが、許可なくされた売買は無効になることから、通常の不動産売買とは少し流れが違います。

	宅地なら建物を建てる計画、雑種地なら駐車場や資材置き場などの計画が必要とされ、転用許可後は速やかに計画を実行する必要があります。
	そのため、先に転用する場合は、申請した転用目的を一旦は達成しなくてはならなくなり、売買が目的なら先に転用する方法は非効率です。
	もっとも、すぐには売れなくても、耕作もできない事情があるなら、一旦は比較的費用がかからない駐車場に転用して、長期的に売り出す方法は十分考えられます。

	登記については、買主負担となる商習慣から、売主の負担はほとんど発生しませんが、費用負担は売買契約によって定められるので、売主負担になることもあります。
	まとめ
	農地の売買は、農地が持つ重要な役割から、法律で規制されています。
	また、農地以外に転用できるかどうかで、売買価格も買い手も異なります。
	農地転用が可能かどうかを知りたいのであれば、農地区分を農業委員会に確認してみるのが確実でしょう。
	また、売買や転用には農業委員会の許可が必要で、しかも許可されるまでには１ヶ月程度（届出による場合は１０日程度）要するため、手間も時間もかける覚悟は必要です。

	農業委員会で不許可になった場合
	売買許可または転用許可は、必ずしも許可されるとは限らないため、農地の売買契約書では、不許可になった場合の条項も定めておきます。
	不許可になった場合は、売買契約が許可を前提としている性質上、当事者からの申し入れがなくても、当然に売買契約が失効して違約金も通常発生しません。
	手付金においても、不許可であればそのまま返還される、いわゆる白紙解除です。
	ただし、不許可を理由としない一方の都合による解約では、一般的な不動産取引と同様に、買主の手付金放棄または売主の手付金倍返しになります。

	３つ目はポイント還元率で選ぶ方法です。
	とにかくクレジットカードを買い物で使ってポイントを貯めたい．．．という方におすすめの比較方法ですね（ポイント還元率とは何？という方は下記記事参照）。
	１ポイントの価値がわかれば、クレジットカードのお得さが即座にわかる！ポイント還元率の計算方法をこの機会に覚えよう。
	但し、ひとことにポイント還元率が高い、低いといっても年会費が別途かかるのではそれもしっかりと考慮しないといけません。

	それでサービス内容に不満があったり、もっといろいろなサービスを使ってみたくなったら、その時に年会費のかかるカードに切り替えればＯＫです（下記記事も参考に）。
	２．カード発行会社で選ぶ：
	次におすすめなのが、クレジットカードの発行会社でどのカードを選ぶかを決めること。
	日本だけでも１００社以上のカード会社がクレジットカードを発行しているので、どの会社を選ぶかだけでもクレジットカードの比較が出来ます。
	大手カード会社がやはりいいのか？
	ではどのクレジットカード発行会社が良いのかというと、これはみなさん次第。
	基本的には大手クレジットカード会社であろうが中小クレジットカード会社であろうが買い物における使い勝手には違いはないのですが、やはりセキュリティ面での安全を重視するとか、万が一の時のサポート体制が気になるという方は大手を選ぶほうが無難です。

	ギターのパンの振り方
	はい、ギターなんですが、ステージ上は「上手（かみて）」「下手（しもて）」という風にツインギターで分かれるのが基本です。
	で、ボーカルギターだったり、ギターが一人だったりするパターンも、もちろんあります。
	では、ＣＤなどの音源に収録する場合はギターはどうすれば良いのか？という話ですが、上記のパターンを無視して左右に振るのが安定です。
	具体的には、以下のような例が良いと思います。

	ＴＶ番組『ダウンタウンのガキの使いやあらへんで！！』内の企画で人気の高い「笑ってはいけない」シリーズ。
	何があっても絶対に「笑ってはいけない」というルールで、出演者は収録に挑みます。
	もし、笑ってしまった場合はその場で罰を受けます。
	「笑ってはいけない」という緊張感がまた、笑いを誘発するのです。
	そんな同企画の仕込みかと思うような広告が、年始早々にＳＮＳを中心に話題となりました。
	その広告とは、小林製薬の鼻うがい製品「ハナノア」。
	鼻うがいとは、鼻の穴からダイレクトに洗浄液を注入するうがいの方法で、これが花粉症などにも効果がみられるのです。
	専用の洗浄液を鼻に入れて流すことで、鼻の奥に入った花粉、ハウスダスト、雑菌などをまるごと洗い流す同製品。
	花粉の時期に「鼻をとってまるごと洗いたい」と思う方には、もってこいの花粉対策といえるでしょう。

	道具のことを書いてしまいましたが一番重要なのはやはり毎日の練習です。
	日々の練習ではロングトーンの他に音階・半音階・アルペジオを混ぜてやると良いでしょう。
	なにか一つ決まった教本を使うといいですね。
	後で記ますね。
	先ほどもいったように何を吹くときでも必ず息の流れに注意して下さい。
	また、演奏会など生のいい音を聴くこと、ＣＤを聴きまくることです。
	自分が出したい音のイメージを持つことがとても大事です。
	ただなんとなく漠然と楽器を吹くのではなく、必ず音に対するイメージを持って、そして息の流れを意識しながら吹く！意識して意識して意識して吹いていって・・・終いには無意識にできればもう最高！こういう習慣ができるといいですね。
	まずは意識をすること。
	必ず上手くなりますよ。
	漠然と吹いているのと注意しながら吹くのでは、まったく違う結果が現れてくるから。
	あなどるなかれ！毎日の積み重ねが大事って事だね。
	以上のお答えは、ＴＷＷサックス奏者：松原孝政氏からいただきました。

	なお、中にはペニシリンに対してアレルギーを有している患者さんがいます。
	この場合はペニシリンアレルギーを防ぐため、ペニシリン系抗生物質を他の抗菌薬に変えて投与しなければいけません。
	どうしてもペニシリン系抗生物質を使用したい場合、少量から投与して徐々に投与量を増やすことで慣れさせていきます。
	これを脱感作といいます。
	脱感作をすれば、ペニシリン系抗生物質を投与しても問題ありません。
	ペニシリン系抗生物質の作用機序
	細菌とヒトの細胞を比べたとき、細菌には細胞壁があるものの、ヒトの細胞には細胞壁がありません。
	そこで、ペニシリン系抗生物質では、細胞壁の合成を阻害することでその作用を発揮します。
	細胞壁がなければ、細菌の細胞内に水が流入してくるようになります。
	その結果、細胞が膨張して破裂し、死滅していきます。
	そのため、ペニシリン系抗生物質は殺菌性抗菌薬に分類されます。

	※思いこみを認識する作業は、心の痛みを伴う場合があります。
	つらい過去を蒸し返すこともあるかもしれません。
	それでも痛みを直視し、客観的に分析する勇気をもたなければ、自分を苦しめている思いこみは明らかになりません。
	紙やパソコンに書きましょう。
	（書くと認識しやすくなります）
	そして、自分がピンときて納得できるまで根気よく、くりかえましょう。
	思いこみが特定できれば、悩みの半分以上を解決したも同然です。
	それでは次に紹介する５つの方法で、悩みを「無効化」していきましょう。

	方法１：「思いこみ」を壊す
	思いこみを壊すには、反対の証拠や例をあげていくのが効果的です。
	先の例で、「私はバカだ」という思いこみの反対の例をあげいきます。
	「私は、一生で一度も、バカだといわれたことがない」
	「私の仕事ぶりは、沢山の人に評価されている。だからバカではない」
	とりあえず、質よりも量が大事です。
	頭のなかで考えるだけでなく、どんどん紙やパソコンに理詰めで書いていきましょう。
	そして最後に感情をこめて読み上げましょう。
	そうすれば、「アッ！これって思い込みだ！」とあなたの脳が客観的に認識するはずです。

	１日を２５時間と認識している体内時計を起床後にリセットすることが必要になります。
	効果的なリセットを行うにはカーテンを開けて太陽の光を浴びることと朝食を取ることが必須です（胃腸が弱い方は朝食は少なめでも構いませんが、一般にはある程度の分量があったほうがリセット効果は高いとされます）。
	可能であれば２０分以上の散歩をするとより効果的です。
	？【３】朝の行き場を作ること
	予備校の本科生にならない場合、たとえば朝食をファストフード店で取り１時間程度の勉強をしてくる習慣をつける、朝９時に図書館に入るなど、朝の行き場を作ることが非常に大切です。
	自宅学習デーであっても、午前中は外出したほうがペースをつかめます。

	３．同じ内容はまとめて書く
	・希望的観測は厳禁
	・業務上、書くべき事は必ず書く（業務を知る）
	・報告書の中に、課題は何か？が明確に書かれている
	それ以外の部分の書き方
	宛名：
	役職の後に「殿」をつける組織とつけない組織がある。
	一般的には、組織としての書き方を上司・先輩に聞いた方がいい。
	氏名の記入と押印：
	報告書には自分の部署と名前を書いて、押印する。
	その際、印はまっすぐ（か、やや左向き（お辞儀をしているように？））に押すこと。
	照会先電話：
	自分の名前の下に、内線表示などの連絡先を書く場合もある。
	項番のつけ方：
	・「１」→「（１）」→「ａ」
	・「１」→「１−１」→「１−１−１」など、
	これも、組織によってルールが決まっているものなので、それにしたがって書く。
	所見（所感）
	「所見」は記す場合と、そうでない場合がある。
	「所見」は、伝えておきたい自分の意見がある場合や、先方の表情や態度などの場の細かなニュアンスなどを報告した方が良いと思ったら、それを１文程度にまとめて書く。
	「所見」には自分の意見が入ってもかまいませんが、極力、自分の主観や推測を入れてはいけません。
	報告書は”事実”を報告するものです。
	特に希望的観測は厳禁です。
	添付資料
	添付資料がある場合は、最後に日時・タイトル・ページ数を書く。
	資料には、ページ数を明記し、「別紙１」「別紙２」などのように番号を表示しておくとわかりやすい。

	その分初心者には育てやすいのですが、他の植物を枯らしてしまうため注意が必要です。
	しかし私達が爽快な清涼感を感じる香り元、ペパーミントの主成分のメントールは冷却作用や鎮痛作用があることから冒頭でもお話ししたように様々な用途があるため私達の生活に役立つハーブの一つです。
	ミントの生育適温と好適環境
	ミントの生育適温は１５〜２５°Ｃです。
	冬は地上部は枯れてしまいますが根は生きていますので翌春また出てきます。
	冬に収穫したい場合は１０°Ｃ以上を維持した室内で管理すれば収穫することができます。
	好適環境は日当たりがよく風通しの良い場所で育てましょう。
	極端な乾燥に弱いので乾燥させすぎには注意です。
	タネと苗から栽培
	ミントはタネからも育てられますが初心者なら苗から栽培を始めた方がより簡単なので今回は苗からの栽培方法で進めていきます。
	苗選びと植え付け時期

	アドレスの種類や属性（無料メールｏｒ携帯メールなど）によっても価格は変化しますが、一例として１０００アドレスで０．５ドル〜１０ドル、１０万アドレスで７０ドル〜１５０ドルほどで取引されています。
	また正規のサービスに登録したアドレスが、同意した規約の範囲内で別のサービスの情報送信に用いられるケースもあります。
	アドレス収集や迷惑メールのパターンなどは、『徹底解剖！迷惑メールの仕組みを全て知り、被害をなくす方法』で詳しく解説しています。
	４．まとめ
	ｉＰｈｏｎｅの迷惑メール対策と、迷惑メールが無尽蔵に送られ続ける仕組みを解説してきましたがいかがでしたか。
	将来的にはともかく、しばらくの間は迷惑メールがなくなることはないでしょう。
	だからこそ、対策と知識を持つことで快適にｉＰｈｏｎｅを使うことができるはずです。

	もっとも強力な方法です。
	後述しますが、世界中の悪徳業者がいろいろな手段を用いてメールアドレスを収集しており、本人がいくら気をつけても知人の電話帳から自分のメールアドレスが流出する可能性があります。
	つまり時間が経つほどそのアドレスは迷惑メールの標的になりやすくなるため、変更することで完全なリセットが可能です。
	もちろん新しいアドレスを知人に通知する必要がありますが、その際に知人が指定したアドレスのみを受信する設定だった場合、メール以外の手段でアドレス変更を知らせなければいけません。
	２．【間接的対処】ｉＰｈｏｎｅへの迷惑メールの影響を減らす方法
	２−１．無料メールを活用し、キャリアメールの使用を限定する
	携帯キャリアのメールアドレス変更は少々手間ですよね。
	またスマホは基本的にメール着信がユーザーに通知されるため、メールの開封率がパソコンのメールにくらべ高い傾向にあります。
	だからこそ悪徳業者にとって、携帯キャリアのメールアドレスは美味しいターゲットなのです。
	であれば、携帯キャリアのアドレスをあえて使わず、無料で取得できるＧｍａｉｌ、Ｙａｈｏｏ！メールなどを、携帯メールがわりに使うという手があります。
	≪無料メールを使う４つのメリット≫
	１．無料でいくつでも取得できる

	スーツでよく使われる素材についてです。
	カジュアルだと素材より見た目重視の方が多いでしょうが、スーツでは生地自体にもこだわって欲しいです。
	スーツは休日以外ほぼ毎日着るとなると私服よりもずっと着用時間は長くなります。
	そうなるとスーツへのダメージも増えていき、着こなしの大敵であるシワや、着用感の低下から印象も変わってきてしまいます。
	そのため各素材の特徴を知り自分に合った素材を選び、それらをなるべく防ぐことが日々の正しい着こなしにも繋がってくるのです。

	またシワになっても２、３日ハンガーにかけておくとほとんどシワが取れるので３着ほどをローテーションして着るようにするのがオススメです。
	予算が限られている方や出張が多い方はポリ混でできるだけウール１００％に近い見た目の生地にしましょう。
	見た目の判別のみで問題ないですが、基本的にウールの比率が多いとウール寄りの機能と見た目に、ポリエステルが多いとポリエステルよりの機能と見た目になります。
	まとめ
	まとめると、
	チャコールグレーの無地かピンストライプ
	ミディアムグレーの無地かピンストライプ
	ダークネイビーのピンストライプ
	で、ウール１００％の生地
	を、３着程度ローテーションが理想となります。
	もしスーツを１着もお持ちでない方はこのまま、何着かお持ちの方は買い足す際の参考にしていただければオーケーです。
	知識的な内容が多くなってしまったので、全て覚えずともポイントだけつかんで実践していただけたら幸いです。

	※両親以外や会社の上司を祝う場合は？
	昔は６０歳で引退される方が多かったようですが、今はまだまだ現役
	なんて方も沢山いらしゃいるので、そんな方へ感謝を込めて還暦祝いをされることも多いですよね。
	お祝いのされ方は様々ですが、慰安旅行中にプレゼントしたり、内緒にしていて職場で誕生日に渡したりして、ちょっとサプライズな演出をされるなど渡す側も楽しまれてはいかがでしょうか？

	そうそう、あとはお祝いする方が集まりやすい時！
	お正月やゴールデンウイーク、お盆休みなどご家族が揃われるタイミングにお祝いをされる方も多いですね。
	６０才で定年退職される方も多いので、ご勇退記念を兼ねてされる方もおられます。
	「還暦のお祝いにしようか、退職のお祝いにしようか悩んでるんです」ってご相談されることもあります。
	ご一緒にお祝いされる方は定年退職前にお祝いをされるなら還暦の祝い、定年退職直後にされるなら退職のお祝いにされたりしても良いかもしれませんね。
	色々なことを書きましたが、形にとらわれずお祝いしたいという気持ちが一番大切かと思います。
	６０歳の誕生日がある年で、参加者やもちろんご本人の都合が良い時にされればいいと思います。
	現在の６０歳の方はまだまだお若いです。
	６０歳の年を過ぎた場合でも、お誕生日やご家族が集まった際に６０歳の時にはできなかったけど、感謝の気持ちを届ける機会を設けるのも良いのではないでしょうか。
	形ではなくその気持ちが一番のプレゼントかと思います。

	３．報告書の具体的な書き方
	（１）標題
	文書の概要が一目で伝わるように１５〜２０字で具体的に書きます。
	△「出張報告」
	△「安心メディカルへの出張の件」
	○「安心メディカル本社への「とるとる」販売に関する出張報告」
	日付、具体的な報告内容を標題に込めると内容を理解しやすくなります（よって、中身を詳しく読んでくれる事となります）。
	（２）本文
	簡潔に「標題（掲題）の件につき、下記の通り、ご報告いたします」と書きます。
	その後で、文書の場合は「記」と真ん中に記して、箇条書きで各項目を続ける（メールの場合は「記」を省略する）。
	最後は「以上」で締める。
	（３）状況説明
	状況説明は項目分けして箇条書きにして書きます。
	将来、万一、将来、トラブルが発生した場合には重要な証拠にもなりますので、あくまで正確に書いてください。

	（４）要旨の作り方〜重要な内容を３つ程度でまとめる
	先に述べた通り、要旨は文章を作って、その内容を要約し、最後に作るべきものです。
	報告書に「内容要旨」が必要な理由は、読み手がそこを見て、すぐに報告書の「結果」（結論）が理解できるためです。
	報告書を読むのは、自分より立場が上で、忙しく、報告書の文書などで余計な時間を取りたくないと考えている方です。
	報告書の「内容要旨」は重要なことを３つ程度書く。
	分量としては３行程度（５０字程度）
	〜人が一度に理解しやすい分量はこれぐらい。
	報告相手（上司）の知りたいことを書くよう心がける。

	【注意点】
	・（株）（略称の使用は不可、株式会社と書くべき、また、通称ではなく、フルネームで書くべき）
	・名前の間違い（漢字間違い、旧漢字が正しいなど）
	・役職間違い（本来部長なのに課長とするなど）

	２−２．報告書作成のポイント
	〜文字量に着目する
	文字量に留意しながら報告書を作成すると、目的にあった上手な報告書が書けます。
	・一言で報告する場合＝５０字（＝１２〜１３秒）にまとめる
	・簡潔に１分で報告する場合＝２００字
	・一般的な報告書を作る（要旨＋詳細内容）＝Ａ４用紙１枚で要旨、２枚〜３枚で詳細内容
	２−３．報告書作成のポイント
	〜文書表現の注意点
	●「ですます調」と「である調」の混同をしない
	一気に文書を書き上げた場合には、特に見直しが必要です。
	必ず読み直して、チェックしましょう。
	●助詞の重複を避ける
	同じ助詞が３回以上連続すると読みにくくなります。
	そのような場合は文章を分割する等、構成や表現を変えましょう。
	●句読点の打ち方

	ローソク足が表すこと
	ローソク足が理解できれば、見るだけで、その日の株価の値動きを把握することができます。
	下図は代表的なローソク足を紹介した図です。
	足の長さや、実体（本体）の色、大きさで呼び名も、線の性質も違うことが分かります。
	＜基礎編＞
	＜応用編＞
	※代表的なローソク足を紹介していますが、この見方が絶対的に正しいというものではありません。
	これらの線は安値圏で出るか、中値で出るか、高値圏で出るかによって大きく意味は異なってきます。
	過去の値動きを基に統計的に、そうなりやすいという一つの考え方としてご活用ください。

	５まとめ
	いかがでしたか。
	株価は市場が提供するとても重要な情報ですが、よりよく活用するにはもう少し踏み込んで理解する必要があります。
	そのためには次の３つをしっかり押さえておきましょう。
	●会社の株主の価値の合計である株式時価総額を理解する
	●株価の高・低と、株価が割高・割安であることは別にして考える
	●株価の割高・割安は、以下の２面からチェックする
	？過去の株価の水準と比べて現在の株価の位置はどこにあるのか、という考え方で割高・割安を判断する
	？株価収益率（ＰＥＲ）や株価純資産倍率（ＰＢＲ）を手掛かりに、株価が割高か割安かを考える。
	特に、同業他社との比較は重要。
	上記の３点を頭に入れた上で、新聞やインターネットの株式欄をチェックする習慣をつけてください。
	株式欄をチェックする際のおすすめは、新高値・新安値の銘柄をフォローすることです。
	市場の評価を上げている銘柄、あるいは下げている銘柄を定期的に見ることで、さまざまな株価の動きをより深く理解できるようになります。
	株価チャートとは？
	チャートとは１日、１週間、１ヶ月といった期間の株価をグラフ化して見やすくしたものです。
	ただ、株価を見ただけでは、安いか、高いかを判断できません。
	そんなときに参考として用いられます。
	また、相場のトレンドや過熱状態等を捉えるために活用することもできます。

	日々の株価情報欄は株式投資をする方には必見です。
	ここでは必ず押さえておくべき点を解説します。
	銘柄：
	銘柄名が無印の場合以外に、Ａ、ａ、・などの記号があります。
	これは売買単位（取引において何株をまとめて売買するのか）を示します。
	無印とｋは１０００株、Ａとａは１００株、Ｂは１株、Ｃは１０株、Ｄは５０株、Ｅは５００株などとなっています。
	また・は貸借銘柄（たいしゃくめいがら）を示します。
	貸借銘柄とは制度信用取引で空売りが可能な銘柄のことですが、株を始めて間もない方がすぐに知っておく必要のある内容ではありません。

	新聞の株価欄の活用法
	さて、以上のようなデータ、細かいなぁとお感じかもしれません。
	しかし始値、高値、安値、終値、前日比、売買高というデータは実はいろいろなチャートを作るときの入力データです。
	よって、この６つの数字から１日の値動きのポイントが分かります。
	投資家は「今日はいくらで始まり、どこまで上がり、どこまで下がり、結局どの水準で終わったのかな、売買は多かったのかな」とイメージし、その銘柄を積極的に買いたいのか売りたいのか判断しています。
	また、新聞の良さは網羅性です。
	すべての銘柄が掲載されていますので、定期的にこれを眺めていると、人気が出て買われている銘柄や業種、逆に人気がなくなり下げている銘柄や業種が見えてくるようになります。
	プロやベテランが活用しているテクニックの１つに、新高値・新安値の銘柄に着目するという手法があります。
	新聞ではこれをビジュアル的に一目で追うことができ、大変便利です。
	日本経済新聞などでは、新高値・新安値銘柄が黒ベタ白抜き（白い字）で示されているからです。
	高値の欄にこれがあるときは新高値がついたこと、安値の欄にこれがあるときは新安値がついたことが分かります。
	新高（安）値は、年初来一番高い（安い）株価のことを意味します（３月までは前年からの最高値、最安値）。
	新聞では、どの業種のどういう銘柄がその年の高値まで買われているのか、その年の安値で売られているのかが一目で俯瞰できます。
	株式市場の物色動向を知る一番身近な手がかりとして重宝しますので、新聞を購読されている場合はぜひ注目してください。
	インターネットの株価欄の見方
	「新聞はもう取っていない」「もっとタイムリーに株価を知りたい」というニーズには、Ｙａｈｏｏ！ファイナンスや証券会社のインターネットサイトの個別銘柄欄（ページ）を活用してください。
	チェックするべき項目は、先ほど新聞の日々の株価動向で取り上げた項目で既に網羅してあります。
	必要があれば新聞の株価欄の見方を改めて参考にしてください。
	また、新高値・新安値をまとめて見ることができるページがあります。
	定期的にチェックして市場の動向を追うと良いと思います。

	１−４．電源スイッチを押して反応するか
	電源スイッチを押して起動しようとした場合、Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓパソコンの多くの機種では「ピッ」という電子音が、Ｍａｃパソコンでは「ジャ〜ン」という音が鳴って起動しはじめます。
	これらの音がそもそもしない場合には、電力の供給に何らかの問題があると考えられます。
	動かなくなったタイミングは？
	２．状態を確認したら原因を特定する
	状態によって、いろいろわかることがあります。
	でも、原因を即断するのは危険です。
	判断を間違えれば状態を悪化させるということもあるので注意しましょう。
	この段落で原因を特定し、次の段落で原因ごとの対処法を説明します。
