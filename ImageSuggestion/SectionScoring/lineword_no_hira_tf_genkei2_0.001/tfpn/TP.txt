	・毛嚢炎のリスク
	カミソリなどの自己処理に比べると毛嚢炎ができる確率は低いですが、ゼロではありません。
	毛穴が少し傷ついただけで毛嚢炎はできることがあります。
	光脱毛では、熱を利用してムダ毛にダメージを与える仕組みなので、毛根周辺の毛包や表皮にも多少の熱ダメージが残ります。
	脱毛施術後の肌は一時的にバリア機能が下がりやすいので、ブドウ球菌がダメージを受けた毛包に入り込んできて、毛嚢炎を引き起こしてしまうことがあります。

	設問の流れとしては、消費者が商品を知ったきっかけ〜購入にいたるプロセス、購入後の満足度、今後の継続意向という順に聞くことが一般的です。
	回答者が思い起こしやすいよう、時系列をあわせる。
	また満足度については、先に総合満足度を聞き、その後に詳細満足度を聞くことがセオリーです。
	掘り下げていくような設問設計をする場合は、まずは総合的・一般的な質問をし、その後に詳細を聞くようにしましょう。
	※詳細満足度を先に聞くと、その内容が回答者の頭に入り総合満足度の結果が変わってしまう（バイアスがかかる）ことにつながります。

	単一選択型の場合、回答者は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	答えやすくなる理由は、「すでに用意された選択肢のなかから、どれかひとつを選ぶだけで済む」ためです。
	自由回答型（ＦＡ）の項目の場合、回答者はゼロから記載する内容を考えざるを得なくなるので、圧倒的に回答ハードルは高くなります。

	語源とする説もいろいろとあるようですが、日本古来の音楽であります、「雅楽（ががく）」の中の一曲に、「千秋楽」という特別な曲があるそうです。
	こちらの楽曲が、必ず最後の曲として演奏されていた事にちなんで、最後日にかけて、「千秋楽」と呼び出したようです。
	また、呼び方を省略して「楽日（らくび）」と言ったり、最終日の先日のことを、「前楽（まえらく）」と言ったりもするそうです。
	「千秋」が略されているのですね。
	ちなみに「千穐楽」と記述する場合も多いようですが、これは「秋」の字に「火」が入っている為、その昔、火事の多かった繁華街では、火事を連想する「火」を意味嫌い「穐」と記述していたのだそうです。
	言葉一つにもいろいろなルーツがあって、調べてみると面白いものですね。

	水引の結び方には一度結んだらほどけない「結びきり」と、ほどいて何度も結ぶことのできる結び方の「蝶結び」があります。
	［結びきり］は結婚や、お悔やみごとのように二度とくり返してはいけないことに使い、［蝶結び］は何度もくり返してよい一般的な祝い事に使います。
	のし袋は、奉書紙や半紙を用いて手作りの包みを作ることもできます。
	その場合慶事なら２枚、弔事なら１枚の紙を使いますが、慶事と弔事では折り方が逆になります。
	市販のものを使う場合でも、お金を入れた後に折り方を間違えることの無いようにしましょう。

	統計・分析における開発現場の実態
	独立行政法人情報処理推進機構（ＩＰＡ）の統計（出典：『ソフトウェア開発データ白書２００８』）によると、実に９５％以上のプロジェクトがウォーターフォール型のライフサイクルで開発されています。
	恐らく、ウォーターフォール型のプロセスの方が誰にでも理解しやすいこと、改修案件の場合など前回のプロセスがウォーターフォール型であったため、今回も同じプロセスを採用するという心理が働いたりすることが原因ではないかと考えられます。
	次に、ユーザーの要求仕様に関して、３５％以上のプロジェクトは「あいまい」であり、３０％以上のプロジェクトで「ユーザー担当者の要求仕様への関与が不十分」という統計もあります。
	その結果、ＱＣＤをすべて達成したと評価するプロジェクトは全体の２／３程度で、残りは品質、コスト、工期のいずれかの項目が計画通りに達成できなかったというデータもあります。
	このように、３つに１つのプロジェクトは、ウォーターフォールの当初の計画通りに進んでないということになります。
	つまり、プロジェクトの初期段階で完全な計画を立てるのは非常に難しいことが分かります。

	なお、高級車＝ＦＲという話になりましたが、スポーツカーの世界でも後輪駆動が主流です。
	Ｆ１などのレーシングカーはＭＲですし、前回も書いたようにポルシェの代表車種はＲＲです。
	フェラーリもランボルギーニもＭＲです。
	エンジンの置き場所こそ違えど、駆動輪はみんな後輪です。
	レーシングにおいては自動車のバランスは非常に重要です。
	ＦＦ車はどうしてもクルマの前部が重くなりますが、後輪駆動車は前後のバランスが均等に近くなります。
	また後輪駆動のほうがアンダーステアが発生しにくい（オーバーステアが発生しやすい）ので、コーナーを曲がることが重視されるレースの世界では重宝されます。

	ＦＦと違ってＦＲではエンジンの動力をシャフトを使って後輪に伝える必要があります。
	ＦＦよりも大がかりなので、比較的故障する確率は高いと言えます。
	ＦＦではエンジンが横置きなので、クルマの室内が広く取れるというメリットがありました。
	逆にＦＲではエンジンが縦置きなので、室内を広くするためには、結局、クルマ自体を大きくするしかありません。
	するとエンジンの回転方向をタイヤに対して９０度の向きで置く必要が出てきます。
	これをシャフトでクルマの後部に伝え、そこでギアを使って再び向きを９０度変えて後輪を回すわけです。

	インフルエンザの種類
	ヒトに感染するインフルエンザウイルスには、Ａ型・Ｂ型・Ｃ型の３つがあり、現在流行の中心となっているのはＡ型とＢ型です。
	Ａ型は症状が重篤になる傾向があり、死に至ることもあります。
	また感染力が強いため、大流行（パンデミック）を起こしやすく、過去には香港かぜやスペインかぜなどの世界的な流行で多くの死者を出しました。
	２００９年に世界中で流行したいわゆる「新型インフルエンザ」は、Ａ型、Ｈ１Ｎ１亜型というものでした。
	Ｂ型は、Ａ型よりも症状が比較的軽く、限られた地域で流行するケースが見られます。
	Ｃ型は鼻かぜ程度の軽い症状ですむことが多いウイルスです。

	インフルエンザの治療
	【一般療法】
	できるだけ安静にし、栄養と十分な睡眠を取ります。
	インフルエンザウイルスの空気中での活動や感染を抑えるために、加湿器などで室内の湿度を５０〜６０％に保ちます。
	水分を十分に補います。
	お茶、スープ、ジュースなど何でもいいので飲みたいものを飲みます。
	【対症療法】
	発熱や関節痛などに対しては解熱鎮痛薬、鼻水やくしゃみに抗ヒスタミン薬などが用いられます。
	一方、インフルエンザの症状はインフルエンザウイルスに対して免疫が正常に働いている結果であり、薬で無理に抑えないほうがよいという考え方もあります。
	市販の薬を自己判断で使用することは、かえって逆効果になる場合があるので、医師の指示にしたがってください。

	この投資家の方は、シャープの株価が下がると予想していたため、証券会社からシャープの株を借りてきて、その株を売りました。
	シャープの株価が下がったら、その時点でシャープの株を買い戻して、証券会社にシャープの株を返済するつもりでした。
	ところが、この投資家の意に反してシャープの株価は上昇してしまいました。
	この投資家の方は高い株価でシャープの株を買い戻して証券会社にシャープ株を返済する羽目になったのです。
	信用取引の場合は自己資金の約３倍の売買が可能になるため、利益も損失も大きくなりがちなのです。
	初心者の方は信用取引には決して手を出さず、最低３年程度は現物取引（通常の株式投資）で経験を積んでください。

	国債金利は
	国債の買い手が増える→国債金利が下がる
	国債の売り手が増える→国債金利が上がる
	という関係にあります。
	買う人が増えると、金利が小さくても売れるため、国債の金利が下がるのです。
	逆に売り手が多くて、買い手が少ない状況だと、金利を高く設定しないと売れないため、国債金利が上がるのです。

	・景気は良くなるのか？
	日本の景気が良くなれば、政策金利が上昇することになり、変動金利が高くなります。
	しかし、２０１７年という時点での景気回復は見通しが立っていないのが現状です。
	アベノミクスでの株価上昇というのは経済が良くなったのではなく、為替介入による円安誘導で株価が上がったに過ぎません。
	円安になると輸出企業の多い日本では、株高になるからです。
	日本円というのは不思議な立ち位置で、世界の経済情勢が悪化すると、外国人投資家・機関投資家はすぐに「円買い」に動きます。
	世界的にはまだ「円」は安全な通貨と認識されているのです。
	世界のどこかで経済的な不安を感じさせる事件があれば、すぐに円高になり、株安に戻ってしまうのです。
	為替だけでつくられたまやかしの株高は長くは続かないのです。
	アベノミクスの流れに沿うように商品価格を上げた企業も、続々とデフレ基準の価格に戻しています。
	個人の収入が増えていないのですから「商品価格を上げても売れなくなっただけ」というのがここ２年ぐらいでばれてしまったのです。
	為替に頼らないで景気回復をするためには、構造改革が必要となり、時間を要するのです。
	２０１７年に景気が回復する見通しというのは立たないのです。

	２０１７年の住宅ローン金利動向予測
	あくまで、２０１６年１２月時点での当サイト編集者の考えですが・・・
	景気が回復する見通しは立っていない
	政策金利も０．１％のゼロ金利政策のまま
	日銀がマイナス金利を維持・拡大する可能性が高い
	日銀は金利ターゲットを導入した
	英国のＥＵ離脱の波及でさらに円高／株安、国債金利低下がすすむ可能性がある
	トランプ大統領就任によるドル高／円安／株高による住宅ローン金利上昇の影響は限定された範囲
	という理由から
	２０１７年は
	変動金利はそのままの低金利状態が維持される
	固定金利は金利ターゲットの影響で、１０年以上の固定金利はやや上昇。
	２年、３年、５年という短期金利はさらに低金利になる
	と予測されます。

	・毛嚢炎のリスク
	カミソリなどの自己処理に比べると毛嚢炎ができる確率は低いですが、ゼロではありません。
	毛穴が少し傷ついただけで毛嚢炎はできることがあります。
	光脱毛では、熱を利用してムダ毛にダメージを与える仕組みなので、毛根周辺の毛包や表皮にも多少の熱ダメージが残ります。
	脱毛施術後の肌は一時的にバリア機能が下がりやすいので、ブドウ球菌がダメージを受けた毛包に入り込んできて、毛嚢炎を引き起こしてしまうことがあります。

	・硬毛化・多毛化
	産毛が濃く硬くなったり、生えていなかった場所から毛が生えることがあります。
	科学的原因はハッキリしていませんが、熱量が関係していると言われています。
	同じ熱量でも太い毛は熱を集めることができるので毛の抑制が上手くいきます。
	一方、産毛などに同じ熱量を照射した場合、メラニン色素が少ないため、熱を毛に上手く届けることができず、結果弱い熱量が毛に届きます。
	これが、成長を活性化させているという説が有力です。

	日焼けした肌が脱毛できない理由
	脱毛機はメラニン（黒いもの）に反応する仕組み→肌が日焼けで黒くなる→毛の黒に反応しにくくなる
	日焼けで肌が乾燥する→痛みを感じやすくなる
	日焼けで肌が黒くなる→メラニンに必要以上に反応して痛みを感じやすくなる
	対策
	小麦肌が好きな方は、夏は特に焼きたいと思うので、夏までに脱毛が完了するよに計算して脱毛を開始しましょう。
	脱毛期間中は日焼けを控えて、脱毛完了後肌が落ち着いてから焼くのがオススメです。
	オススメのコース
	ラヴォーグのスピードパックだと最短半年で全身の脱毛が完了回数の１２回通えます。

	コーディング規約のメリット・デメリット
	コーディング規約のメリットはプログラマの個性を殺して均質なプログラムを作ること、過去の知識や経験から得られたバグの発生源となりやすいコーディングの防止、インデントやコメントの基準を決めて見やすさ保守性の高さを求める・・・等々です。
	一方、デメリットですが、使える文法を制限してスキルの高いプログラマの生産性を殺したり、過去のプログラムとの互換性を追求するあまり新しい機能の使用を制限したり・・・等々があります。
	一般に、大きなプロジェクトほどコーディング規約の内容は強制的、制限的です。
	これは、大きなプロジェクトだと、スキルの低い人もメンバーに入っていることが多く、コーディングを自由にやらせると、品質が落ちたり、プログラムが見づらく保守性が悪くなるったりするためです。

	安いお酒を避け、高いお酒を飲む
	お酒の値段は非常に重要な二日酔いの指標になります。
	理由は値段が高いほどより不純物を取り除く（メタノールを含む）作業が多く行われているからです。
	同じ蒸留酒であっても高いお酒を飲むほうが二日酔いしにくく体にも優しくなります。
	同じお酒でもメーカーなどによっても成分は異なる
	同じ値段のビールであってもＡ社だと二日酔いしないがＳ社だと二日酔いしやすい、とうい現象はよくあることです。

	４．ミディアムロング
	ビジネスとしては取り入れにくいが、そのふわっとした髪が女性に人気が高いヘアスタイル。
	ロングヘアは少しＵＰしてマッシュスタイルにすることで綺麗なシルエットになります。
	サイドは軽めのツーブロックでメリハリをつけ、全体は束感を出せるようにセニングカットを施してきましょう。
	パーマは外ハネとニュアンスを組み合わせたミックスパーマがおすすめ。
	髪型のセット方法
	全体に空気を入れるように乾かしていく。
	その後水分を少し含んだ状態でワックスを揉み込む。
	ワックスが馴染んだら、軽く流れを作っていく。
	毛束はほぐさず、少し大きめぐらいにしておく。
	最後に外ハネを作り、スプレーをかければ完成。

	疫病の症状と見分け方疫病はどの野菜にも発生する「カビ」による病気で、初期は下葉に水が染みたような病斑が発生し徐々に茎や果実に暗褐色の大きな病斑が発生するようになります。
	疫病が進行すると病斑にうっすらとした白色のカビが生えます。
	特にトマトに良く発生する病気で被害が大きくなります。
	ナスに発生する褐色腐敗病はピーマンやカボチャと同じ疫病菌によるものでナスの果実に発病するとやや凹みがある褐色の病斑となります。

	疫病が蔓延してしまったら
	疫病は初期の頃は発祥する葉数が少ないので葉を摘葉して対策することが出来ますが、株全体に疫病が広がってしまった時は、薬剤を使わない場合は株ごと除去するしか手立てはありません。
	マンションなどで数株だけ栽培している時は、株ごと抜き取る事が出来ないことが多いので、その時は薬剤を利用することを検討して下さい。
	生育初期や収穫前の薬剤使用であれば、決められた量と決められた回数を守って使用すれば人体への影響は殆どありません。

	特許庁によると、商標登録の出願があった後で、手数料が支払われると、申請内容の審査が始まる。
	問題がなければ、６ヶ月程度で商標が登録されるという。
	一方、手数料の支払いがなかったり、（１）申請した商標を使った商品、サービスなどが実現する可能性が低い（２）他人が許可なく著名な名称で出願する（３）「五輪」のような公共性の高い名称を出願する−などに該当すると判断されたりした場合、登録が認められない。
	特許庁は、今回の「ＰＰＡＰ」の商標出願問題について、「個別の案件に関してはコメント差し控える」と回答。
	ただ、こうした審査基準に照らせば、大阪府の企業がピコ太郎側から承諾を得ていない場合、商標登録がされる可能性は低い。

	また、なぜ中間的な種が見つからないのかという説明に、ダーウィンはふたつを挙げている。
	ひとつは属に含まれる種が少ない「異常型」の生物は失敗したグループであるという見方、もうひとつは中間的な種が絶滅してしまった可能性である。
	ダーウィンが例にあげているのは鳥で、ほかのセキツイ動物から孤立しているのは絶滅によって説明できると言う。
	それに比べて、甲殻類は広く多様な種類が連鎖している。

	古代ギリシアのアリストテレスは『動物誌』で動物を有血動物と無血動物に大別し有血動物は哺乳類鳥類卵生四足類魚類の四種類無血動物は軟体類甲殻類昆虫類有殻類から構成されると分類していた。
	有血動物は現在の脊椎動物無血動物は無脊椎動物に相当する。
	現在は界門綱目科属種の分類単位がおかれている。
	各階層の他に必要な場合には中間の階層を置くことがある。
	この場合のには「亜」をつけ亜目・亜科などとする。
	たとえばヒトの分類学的位置は動物界脊つい動物門ほ乳綱サル目（霊長目）ヒト科ヒト亜科ヒト属のヒトである。
	学名はＨｏｍｏｓａｐｉｅｎｓＬＩＮＮＡＥＵＳ１７５８である。
	類人猿もヒト科に含まれヒト科とサルの仲間がサル目に含まれる。
	分類の階層を上がるほど違いが大きくなる。
	なお近年は界より上にドメイン（ｄｏｍａｉｎ）を設ける場合がある。

	彼は発生の比較から地球上のすべての生物群は単一の共通祖先に由来すると考えた。
	そして植物界と動物界に二分されていた生物を植物界・動物界・原生生物界に三分した。
	原生生物は単細胞生物であった。

	言語のイメージはここを見ればだいたい分かってもらえると思う。
	（ＵＲＬ）
	・長所
	Ｊａｖａ並の実行速度とＲｕｂｙ並の書きやすさが合わさり最強に見える。
	Ｊａｖａの資産が使い放題で、Ｅｒｌａｎｇのような並列処理まで合わせ持つのでもう手に負えない。
	コードの量もその辺のスクリプト言語並に短くて済む。
	・短所
	覚えるのにけっこう時間がかかる。
	ＣやＣ＋＋ほどではないけどＪａｖａよりも難易度高め。

	１．Ｊａｖａとは
	・どんな言語か
	ここしばらくＴＩＯＢＥのランキングで１位を取っている有名言語。
	でも親会社はドナドナされた。
	中間コードにコンパイルされＶＭ上で動作するので移植性が高く、Ｗｅｂ系や組込み系、Ａｎｄｒｏｉｄなど幅広い分野で利用されている。
	でも親会社はドナドナされた。
	そんな言語も今ではプロプライエタリの申し子であるＯｒａｃｌｅさんの持ち物となり、今後どうなっていくかは今ひとつ不透明ドナ。
	・長所
	実行速度はＣに及ばないもののスクリプト言語よりは数十倍速い。
	ガベージコレクション付き言語の中では最速クラス。
	下位互換とクロスプラットフォームが割としっかりしているので、一度コードを書けばそれが広い範囲で長期間利用できる。
	Ｊａｖａ１．４で書かれたライブラリが今でも普通にＪａｖａ６から呼ばれていたりするみたいな。
	・短所
	ＶＭを立ち上げるのに時間がかかるので、一瞬で終わる軽い処理を実行する場合はどの言語よりももっさりした動きになる。
	名前空間とか、型の宣言とか、かなり厳密にやらないといけない。
	ダックタイピングなんてお行儀の悪いこともできない。
	ちゃんとインターフェース書きなさい、とな。
	バグを防ぐという意味では厳密さはありがたくもあるけど、コード量は多くなるしディレクトリ構造は複雑になるので、コードを書く時はＩＤＥがないとやってられない。

	半径では、写真にシャープを適用する際のディテールの細かさを指定します。
	半径の値を小さくすると、ディテールの細かいものが多い風景などの写真が美しく仕上がります。
	静物や人物など、それほどディテールの細かくない写真では、半径の値は大きい方が適しています。
	サンプルの写真は、半径が１．０に設定されています。

	原料
	菜種、大豆、とうもろこし、ひまわりの種、ごま、紅花、綿実、こめ、ぶどうの９種類の原材料のうち、いずれかを用いて精製しています。
	また、２種類以上の原材料を混ぜて使う油もあり、その場合は調合サラダ油と言います。
	使い方
	味や匂いにクセがなく、サラダドレッシングの他、マヨネーズなどの原料にも使用されています。
	高温になると劣化しやすいため、炒めものや揚げ物などの料理には向いていないとされていますが、問題なく使用することができます。
	ただ、使い回して古くなった油は健康に害を及ぼしますのでご注意ください。

	危険性
	基本的にはサラダ油と同じ危険性を持っています。
	トランス脂肪酸を保有していますし、リノール酸も含まれています。
	キャノーラ油は加熱調理に使用することが多いので、リノール酸がヒドロキシノネナールになりやすいです。

	「手ぶれ」も「被写体ぶれ」も、共に暗いシーンで起きやすくなります。
	この画像は日没直前の暗い状況で撮ったもので、そのために１／２５秒というかなり長い時間シャッターを開いていたために生じた手ぶれ現象です。
	なお、「手ぶれ」と「被写体ぶれ」以外にも「ぶれ」の生じる場合があります。
	その多くは振動によるもので、自動車の走る橋の上から景色を撮る場合、三脚を据えていても橋の振動による「ぶれ」が生じます。
	あるいは、一眼レフカメラなどの場合、カメラ内部でミラーが動く振動が問題になる場合や、天体撮影などでは人体には関知できない地面の微かな振動さえもが「ぶれ」の原因となります。

	農地売買の大まかな流れ
	どのような農地売買でも、売買契約は農業委員会の許可を前提として締結されます。
	農地として売るなら農地法第３条による売買（所有権移転）許可、農地以外で売るなら農地法第５条による転用許可です（届出の場合もあります）。
	農地売買では、通常の不動産取引ではあまりない、「仮登記」を行うのが通常です。
	許可を条件とした売買契約を締結
	農業委員会に許可申請
	許可前に所有権移転請求権仮登記
	許可後に代金支払いと所有権移転登記（本登記）
	２．の農業委員会への許可申請と３．の仮登記は、順番が前後することに問題はなく、どちらも売買契約締結後、遅滞なく行う条項を１．の売買契約書に盛り込みます。
	また、３．仮登記は売買契約の絶対条件ではないですが、４．の許可まで買主が所有権を得られないために、買主による将来の確実な所有権移転を保全する目的で行われます。
	許可されると農業委員会から許可指令書が交付され、許可指令書がなければ農地の所有権移転登記は受け付けてもらえません。
	許可のない違法な所有権移転を防ぐために、このような仕組みになっています。

	転用して売買する場合の注意点
	農地転用には２種類あります。
	農地の所有者が自ら農地以外の用途で使用する目的
	他者への売買を目的
	農地の所有者が自ら使用するための転用は、農地法４条による転用許可で、売買が目的の農地法５条による転用許可とは扱いが異なります。
	ただ、最終的に他者へ売却するのなら、２つの違いは転用のタイミングに過ぎません。
	先に転用してから売却するか、売却と同時に転用するかという違いです。
	転用はどちらが先でも同じように思えますが、転用許可の制度上、単に転用する許可申請は認められず、転用後の事業計画を必要とします。
	例えば、「とりあえず農地から宅地や雑種地にしておき、後から買主が現れるまで待つ」というような転用許可申請は認められません。

	農地売買の手数料
	農地として売る場合、個人間売買や農業関連機関の斡旋（あっせん）を利用する形態が主で、手数料は登記費用（登録免許税や司法書士報酬）くらいしか発生しません。
	転用による売買では、不動産会社に仲介依頼して売買できるので、登記費用の他にも不動産会社に対して仲介手数料を支払います。
	転用による売買では、転用前提であることを明示すれば、転用許可後に地目変更できるので、農地であっても宅地や雑種地同様に買いやすく、広く買主を探せます。
	したがって、売買価格も農地のまま売るよりも高くなることが想定され、不動産会社への仲介手数料も多くなります。

	従って、自分で「少しアタックが強すぎるかな？」と思うくらいのタンギングをしたほうが良いでしょう。
	ただ、むやみやたらに強くすると逆効果ですので、練習が必要です。

	あとバリトンの場合、マウスピースも違ってきます。
	アルト等で使われるセルマーＣ＊だと狭すぎます。
	クラシックの場合でもセルマーだったらＤ〜Ｅ。
	Ｓ９０でしたら１２０。
	ヤナギサワ等ならば７番くらいのモノをお薦めします。
	もっともこれは演奏者の体格、体力次第ですので、必要以上に番号の大きなモノを使っても意味がありません。
	それでも、ある程度のティップ・オープニング（くわえるところの広さ）があるとバリトンの場合劇的に楽になる場合があります。
	色々試してみて下さい。

	ペニシリン系抗生物質は時間依存性の抗菌薬です。
	また、ＰＡＥが短い（血中濃度が低くなると細菌は増殖を開始する）という性質のため、常にＭＩＣよりも高い血中濃度を維持しなければいけません。
	ただ、ペニシリン系抗生物質の多くは半減期が１時間程度です。
	そのため、１日に何回も投与しなければいけません。
	通常は４〜６時間おきの投与が必要だとされています。
	適切な血中濃度を維持することで、薬の効果を最大限に得ることができ、さらには耐性菌の出現を防ぐことができます。

	かならずそこには「範囲」があるのです。
	思い込みの適応範囲を一部に限定していきましょう。
	時間、場所、状態、人、環境などあらゆる側面から限定していくのです。
	「小学校の時はバカだったかもしれないが、社会人となり家庭を築いている私はもうバカではない」

	※中高一貫校受験の方．．．自分の意志で行う受験経験がなく、勉強法や学習量に不安を持つ人が多いですが、逆に講師に相談して勉強を進める傾向があり、経験がないことが有利に働くケースがよくあります。
	欠点は英語の基礎を作る中３から高１の間で受験の壁を乗り越えていないこと。
	英語が伸び悩む傾向があります。
	※塾通いをせず高校受験をされた方．．．勉強法を確立している人が多く、塾や教材任せにする傾向がないため、大学受験で伸びるケースが良くあります。
	ただし予備校や塾の講師に勉強法を相談することは必要です。

	？浪人し受験に失敗した人の多くが英語を得意科目にできなかった人です。
	英語は配点が高いから重要。
	これが受験生の理解ですが実際にはもう少し深い要素があります。
	それは英語が唯一の「真の積み重ね型の教科」ということです。
	地歴公民は中学校でも習いますが、高校では初めからもう一度習います。
	例えば日本史なら高校で改めて縄文時代から学び直します。
	理科も同様です。
	国語は中学のときに苦手科目であっても、高校から力を入れれば伸びてきます（漢検３級程度の基礎は必要）。
	数学は積み重ねの要素が多少ありますが、英語ほどではなく挽回が可能です。
	？一方英語は中３や高１で苦手教科だった場合には、浪人して人並み勉強をしても苦手が改善されない科目です。
	人の３倍程度勉強時間をとってもなお変化はありません。
	「真の積み重ね型の教科」である英語は、基礎が不十分な場合、スタート時の偏差値が５０ならずっと５０のまま、４５ならずっと４５のまま終わることが多い、逆転が難しい科目です。

	？調べれば何とかなる英語、国語、社会に対して、理科、数学を質問できる環境は必須です。
	質問をしないことで、途中式や解き方の一部を分かったことにしたり暗記したりしてしまうことが学力の向上を大きく妨げます。
	最低でも大学院生または旧帝大レベルの学部生、できれば予備校講師に週に３回程度質問できる環境の確保が重要です。
	※大学院生や大学の学部生のなかでは、該当科目がもともと得意だった人よりも、努力して成果を出した人の方が教え方は優れています。
	また大学院生、大学生の場合、国語が得意な国立大受験経験の講師の方が教え方は優れています。

	報告書内容の注意点
	１．内容に欠落がないか
	報告書においては、内容に欠落があっては、役に立ちません。
	まず、数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）、固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）、単位（千、万、円、ドル、グラム、Ｋｇ等）、相手の意志（反対する、賛成する、購入する、購入しない等）を報告書から漏らしてはいけません。
	読み手に「悟ってもらう」事はありえません。
	ビジネス文書では相手は、自分の文章を「最も批判的に読む」と考えるべきです。
	自分に都合良く、相手が解釈してくれることは絶対にありえません。
	報告書を書き上げたら、妥当かどうかを確認してください。
	２．内容に誤認がないか
	・数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）
	・固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）
	・単位（千、万、円、ドル等）
	・相手の意志（反対、賛成、購入する、購入しない等）
	を勝手に解釈して、事実誤認しないこと。
	誤認によって、今後の動きが違ってくる可能性があるので、事実を正確に把握することはきわめて重要です。
	これを防ぐには、メモを取るときに、重要だと思う点にサインをつけておき、商談・会議の終わりに再確認するのが望ましいと思います。

	ミントの苗選びのコツは、ひょろっと長いものよりも株元から何本も芽が出ている株を選びましょう。
	また地面の近くの下葉の裏をみて斑点状に変色していないものや虫が付いていないかも確認して下さい。
	植え付け時期はハーブ苗が出回る時期に合わせ、だいたい真冬と真夏は避ければいつでも大丈夫です。
	鉢選びと植え付けのコツ
	ミントは地植えと鉢植えの両方できますが生育旺盛で根も張るため植える鉢も大きめの鉢を選ぶ必要があります。
	目安として、市販されている黒いビニールポット３号ポット（直径９ｃｍ）に植えられている苗の場合５〜６号鉢（直径１８ｃｍ）くらいを選びましょう。
	植え付ける土は保湿性のあるハーブ専用培養土か肥料が配合されている野菜栽培用などの培養土を選んでください。
	ミントを植えるときに注意したいのは混植してはいけません。
	ミントは繁殖力が強いため一緒に植えてもミントだらけになってしまい他の植物を枯らしてしまいます。
	また、ミント同士でも種間交雑をしてしまうため１鉢１品種で栽培しましょう。
	水やりと肥料
	ミントは乾燥に弱いので鉢の表面が乾いたら鉢底から水が流れ出るまで水をあげて下さい。
	また肥料に関しては基本的に植え付け時に肥料入りの培養土で植え付けたのなら追肥はあまり必要ありません。
	葉色が黄色くなってきたり葉数を増やしたい場合は固形もしくは液体の肥料を肥料の容器に書かれている用法容量に従って与えて下さい。

	『心配事の９割は起こらない』なんて本が話題になりましたが、実際アメリカで行われた研究の結果、「心配したことの“８５％”は、結局“いい結果”か“良くも悪くもない中立の結果”に終わる」んだとか。
	また、実際に心配事が現実になってしまった場合でも、約８割の人が「自分が想像していたよりも上手く出来事に対処できた！」と語っているそうです。
	「不安はそもそも現実にならないし、もしそうなっても何とかなる！」と科学的に証明されているのはなんだか心強いですね。
	心が押しつぶされてしまいそうな時は、ぜひこの結果を思い出してみて。

	設問の流れとしては、消費者が商品を知ったきっかけ〜購入にいたるプロセス、購入後の満足度、今後の継続意向という順に聞くことが一般的です。
	回答者が思い起こしやすいよう、時系列をあわせる。
	また満足度については、先に総合満足度を聞き、その後に詳細満足度を聞くことがセオリーです。
	掘り下げていくような設問設計をする場合は、まずは総合的・一般的な質問をし、その後に詳細を聞くようにしましょう。
	※詳細満足度を先に聞くと、その内容が回答者の頭に入り総合満足度の結果が変わってしまう（バイアスがかかる）ことにつながります。

	ページ数や設問数が多いと、何問答えれば終わるのかがわからず回答者が不安になり、離脱しやすくなります。
	対策として、アンケートフォームの右上などに「現在のページ数」と「全体のページ数」を記載しておくと、回答者に安心感を与えることができます。

	上述した通り、おすすめは単一選択型（ＳＡ）です。
	単一選択型の場合、回答者は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	答えやすくなる理由は、「すでに用意された選択肢のなかから、どれかひとつを選ぶだけで済む」ためです。
	自由回答型（ＦＡ）の項目の場合、回答者はゼロから記載する内容を考えざるを得なくなるので、圧倒的に回答ハードルは高くなります。

	３答えやすい質問・内容になればなるほど、回答率は上がる
	答えやすいアンケートを作成するために、「ターゲット」に合わせた口調で調査票の文章を設計しましょう。
	ポイントは、「わかりやすい文章」「ターゲット」「専門用語」「対象」「時期」「回答形式（単一選択型）」です。
	「わかりやすい文章」で質問文を書く
	意識的に、一文の長さを短めに設計すると端的でわかりやすくなります。
	また、「ターゲット」が取引先のお客様であれば、その業界に特有の「専門用語」などは通じますが、一般消費者がターゲットの場合は平易な日本語に置き換える、など工夫も必要です。
	「対象（誰、どこ、何についての質問なのか）」について明確にする
	「時期（過去・現在・未来）」を明確にする
	「回答形式」は「単一選択型」がおすすめ
	単一選択型の回答形式は、回答する側は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	回答形式については、詳細を後述します。

	アンケートには、「紙で行う場合」と「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行う場合」がありますが、弊社では、回答者がネット環境に接続できない理由がある（たとえばターゲットが高齢者のみの場合など）といった特殊なケース以外では、「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行うアンケート」をおすすめしています。
	アンケートの作成・データ収集・集計など、アンケート業務のほとんどのプロセスにおいて、業務を効率化できコストダウンも図れるためです。
	たとえば、弊社のクラウドサービスＳｙｎｅｒｇｙ！３６０の場合、回答内容によって異なる設問（ページ）へフォームを分岐できるので、Ｗｅｂフォームを活用すれば回答者の負担軽減も可能になり、回答率の向上が図れます。
	「問１にＡと回答した人は問３のページへ飛ぶ、Ｂと回答した人は問５のページへ飛ぶ」のような「設問の条件分岐」の設定が簡単に実現できます。

	次にアンケートの回答です。
	それぞれの問題のページをアンケートの問題のリンクから開き、それを見ながら回答してください。
	問題ページの最上段には「お手本フレーズ」があり、その下には１〜５までフレーズが表示されています。
	ページを開いたらはじめに下図に示すような問題コードをコピーして回答フォームの「問題コード」欄にペーストしてください。
	そして次にお手本フレーズを何回か聴いたり弾いたりしてだいたいの音が口ずさめる、手の位置がわかる程度でいいので、覚えてください。
	その状態で下部に示されている１〜５のフレーズを見てください．１〜５のフレーズはお手本フレーズと似せて作った類似フレーズです。
	お手本フレーズとこれらの類似フレーズを見比べたり、実際に楽器を弾いたりして、お手本フレーズとどこが違うのか、またはどこが同じなのかを見ていただき、お手本フレーズと似ているフレーズの順位をつけていただきます。
	そして、その順位に基づいて回答してください。
	例えば「１．」が一番似ていて、順に「４．」「３．」と似ていた場合、下図のように回答してください。
	４番目、５番目に似ているものは「該当なし」にチェックをしてください。
	また同順位というものには、同順位でつけていただいてもかまいません。
	各フレーズにはＭＩＤＩ音源も載せてありますので必要に応じて聞いてください。
	（ただし、あくまで参考程度にしかならない程度の音源です。）
	また類似フレーズの右側には小さく下図のようにお手本フレーズを示してあるので回答の際の参考にしてください

	体にウイルスなどの敵が侵入すると、白血球内のリンパ球に存在する免疫細胞が、攻撃をしかけて撃退します。
	このときに抗体を作り、再び同じ敵が侵入してきたときのために備えます。
	この抗体が「ＩｇＥ抗体」と呼ばれるもので、花粉を敵と勘違いして、花粉に接触する度に「ＩｇＥ抗体」が作られて体内に蓄積され、ある水準を超えると花粉症として発症します。
	また、免疫細胞である「Ｔｈ１細胞」と「Ｔｈ２細胞」も、花粉症を発生させる原因のひとつといわれています。
	その仕組みは、アレルギー反応を促す「Ｔｈ２細胞」と、それを見張ってアレルギー反応を抑える「Ｔｈ１細胞」のバランスが崩れることで、花粉症などのアレルギーが発症するというものです。

	他にも、顔にむくみがある場合は腎臓や心臓疾患、顔色が悪くめまいがする場合は貧血や更年期障害、低血圧症のおそれがあります。
	更年期障害の場合は、閉経の前後に女性ホルモンのバランスの変化により、だるさや疲れ、不眠などの症状が出ます。
	さらに大きな病気の前触れとして、うつ病や心身症などの精神疾患や、慢性肝炎や肝硬変などの肝臓の疾患、胃がん、大腸がん、糖尿病、結核、慢性腎盂腎炎などの症状としてだるさや倦怠感が現れることもあります。
	疲労からなりやすいと言われるうつ病は、特別な疾患はないにも関わらず、だるさが続き、気力が低下したり、落ち込むことがあります。
	だるさや倦怠感を感じた場合、まず休養を取ることが大切ですが、なかなか回復しない場合は他の病気の可能性はないかと疑うことも必要です。

	そのほか、一時的な疲労回復には糖分が役立ちますが、とりすぎるとかえって身体がだるくなることもありますので気を付けてくださいね。

	内科の病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感
	内科の病気の症状が現れる前に、疲労感が現れることもあります。
	時間が経つとそれぞれの病気が持つ特徴的な症状が現れますが、それまでの病気がまだ分かっていない間に疲労感は現れます。
	精神的なストレスの蓄積や過労、睡眠不足、心配事などが原因で、軽いうつ病の症状として疲労感を感じることがあります。
	また、自律神経障害の症状として疲労感が生じることもあります。
	また、立ち仕事やパソコン業務の長時間労働などにより肉体的な疲労感を感じることもあります。
	同じ姿勢で長時間いることで一部の筋肉しか使われず、特定の筋肉のこりを生じやすいからです。
	筋肉のこりは肩や首、頭部にかけて生じることが多いため、頭痛やめまい、目の奥が痛むなどの症状が現れることがあります。
	他にも、睡眠時無呼吸症候群や慢性疲労症候群、潜在的ビタミンＢ１欠乏症、糖尿病などの病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感もあります。
	回復しないだるさや倦怠感がある場合は、重大な病気が潜んでいることもあるので、病院で診てもらう必要があります。
	また、定期的に人間ドッグなどの健康診断を受けることも大切です。

	花粉症の改善に効果が期待できるとして注目される代表的な乳酸菌とビフィズス菌には、以下のようなものがあります。
	●フェカリス菌
	加熱殺菌して死滅した状態で摂取しても高い効果が得られる新型乳酸菌。
	スギ花粉症患者２０名に曝露（ばくろ）室で人工的に一定量の花粉を浴びてもらい、その後、フェカリス菌入り乳性飲料を１日１本２か月間飲用後にも同じ実験を実施。
	飲む前と後では、鼻かみ回数や目のかゆみなどが減り、アレルギー症状が改善する傾向が認められました。
	●Ｌ−９２乳酸菌
	花粉症にかかった人を対象に、一定期間にわたってＬ−９２乳酸菌を摂取してもらったところ、
	アレルギーの原因となる「Ｔｈ２細胞」を活性化する物質が抑えられました。
	その結果、花粉症の改善に効果があることが立証されました。
	●ＫＷ乳酸菌
	花粉症患者９６人にＫＷ乳酸菌の粉末を摂取してもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善。
	また、マウスによる実験において、血中のＩｇＥ濃度が低下し、Ｔｈ２細胞とＴｈ１細胞のバランスが改善されたことも報告されています。
	●ビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６
	スギ花粉が飛び始める約１か月前から１３週間にわたって、花粉症患者４４名にビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６粉末を飲んでもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善されたという実験結果が報告されています。
	以上は代表的なものですが、今後もさらに注目の新しい菌が発見される可能性もあります。

	実はブラックとネイビー無地は悪い意味でシンプルになりがちです。
	スーツスタイルのコーディネート配色のポイントの１つがコントラストをつけすぎないことです。
	グレーに比べブラックやネイビーはコーディネートでよく使われる白シャツとのコントラストが強まり、フォーマル寄りのイメージが強まります。
	するとシンプルなイメージが強まり、毎回同じコーディネートに見られたり地味な印象を受けられやすくなります。
	そのため就活生っぽく見えてしまったり、素材の良し悪しの影響やコーディネートが似た印象になり、いまいちパッとしないイメージになりがちです。
	抽象的ですがビジネスシーンではフォーマルすぎないバランスが大事になってきます。
	そのフォーマルすぎないバランスを取れる色がグレー系と柄ありのネイビーになるのです。
	白シャツと合わせてもコントラストが低いので、良い意味で自然にぼやけてくれてネクタイの合わせやすさや優しい印象に繋がります。
	コーディネートのしやすさと地味すぎない適度な華やかさを考慮すると上の３種類に定まってきます。
	生地は基本的にウール１００％で探すのをオススメします。

	ブラック
	スーツにおいて最もフォーマルで最も着こなしが難しいのがブラックです。
	ブラックスーツは着用されるシーンによってトーンの変化があります。
	例えば、冠婚葬祭の中でも慎み深さが必要なお葬式に適しているブラックとビジネス用として使われるブラックとは色の濃さで分かれています。
	その着こなしは次回以降で紹介予定ですが、お葬式では真っ黒の生地が適していてビジネスシーンでは少しグレーがかった薄めのブラックが定番となっています。
	このようにひとつの色でもトーンを変えることで印象の違いが出てきます。
	グレー
	海外でのビジネスシーンにおけるスタンドカラーがグレーです。
	ブラックよりも柔らかく、後述するネイビーより大人っぽく落ち着いた印象になるので使い勝手は抜群です。
	グレーはトーンの違いによって３種類に分けられます。
	最もトーンの高いグレーがライトグレー、暗いグレーがチャコールグレー、その真ん中がミディアムグレーになります。
	印象の変化としては明るいほど華やかで清潔感のある印象に、暗いほど誠実さやフォーマル感の増す印象になります。
	これはほぼすべての色に当てはまる特徴です。
	ネイビー
	ネイビーもスーツではスタンダードな色になります。
	ブラック、グレーより若々しく爽やかな印象になるのでどの年代の方にもお勧めできる色です。
	ネイビーも名称はそれぞれですが、ダークネイビー、ネイビー、ブルーなどトーンによって印象に変化があります。
	日本人にとって最も肌馴染みが良くしっくり感じやすいのがネイビー系になるので、自然に所有しているスーツで一番多い色になりがちです。
	ビジネスシーンの一般的なスーツの色はこのブラック、グレー系、ネイビー系になります。
	ただし、必ずしも世間のイメージと着こなしが一致するとは限りません。
	詳しくは後述しますが、この中から整って見えやすい＝おしゃれな印象を与えやすいものを選ぶことが必要です。
	また仕事によっては明るめのグレーやブルーには注意が必要です。
	日本のビジネスシーンでは落ち着きや信頼感が重視されるので、できれば抑えめのトーンで選んであげるといいでしょう。

	株価収益率はトヨタが１０倍、スズキが１７倍になっています。
	トヨタの株価はトヨタ１年分の１株純利益の１０年分、スズキは１７年分ですので、スズキのほうが投資家の人気・期待が高く割高と言えます。

	一方で問題が発生している場合は、コンピューターはどんな異常が発生しているのかを利用者に知らせるようにできています。
	これには、画面が真っ青になって（ブルースクリーンといいます）英語で異常報告が行われる場合と、黒い画面に異常報告がおこなわれる場合があります。
	これらの異常報告画面が表示されたときには、専門家でない限り、手出しはしない方がよいでしょう。
	可能ならば異常報告画面を記録しておき、メーカーやお店のサポートいった専門家に相談しましょう。

	・ソフトウェアのアップデートが累積している場合
	ＷｉｎｄｏｗｓＵｐｄａｔｅ、ＡｐｐＳｔｏｒｅのソフトウェアアップデート、Ａｄｏｂｅ製品のアップデート、ＪａｖａＵｐｄａｔｅのような「更新」が累積していると、インターネットに接続したときにまとめてアップデートが実行され、画面表示がまったく追いつかなくなることがあります。
	この場合も気長に待つことになります。
	また更新の際には、ハードディスクの動作ランプが激しく明滅しますので、判断のポイントになります。
	根本的な対処方法として、パソコンをこれまでよりたくさん起動する、アップデート情報に敏感になるなどの意識が必要です。
	これらのソフトはインターネットで個別に「手動アップデート」をすることもできますので、これを利用するのもよいでしょう。

	なぜなら、肉の繊維が細かく脂肪が甘くあっさりしていて、くさみが少なく、脂肪の溶ける温度が一般のオス牛より低くジューシーだからです。
	さて、牛肉には各部位にそれぞれ特徴があり、その取り扱い方によっておいしさの違いがでてきます。
	購入する際、鮮やかな赤色をした新鮮なものを選び、鮮度のよいうちに使いきるのが大切なポイン卜です。
	ここでは美味しい牛肉のいろいろな部位についてご紹介します。

	なお、高級車＝ＦＲという話になりましたが、スポーツカーの世界でも後輪駆動が主流です。
	Ｆ１などのレーシングカーはＭＲですし、前回も書いたようにポルシェの代表車種はＲＲです。
	フェラーリもランボルギーニもＭＲです。
	エンジンの置き場所こそ違えど、駆動輪はみんな後輪です。
	レーシングにおいては自動車のバランスは非常に重要です。
	ＦＦ車はどうしてもクルマの前部が重くなりますが、後輪駆動車は前後のバランスが均等に近くなります。
	また後輪駆動のほうがアンダーステアが発生しにくい（オーバーステアが発生しやすい）ので、コーナーを曲がることが重視されるレースの世界では重宝されます。

	ＦＦと違ってＦＲではエンジンの動力をシャフトを使って後輪に伝える必要があります。
	ＦＦよりも大がかりなので、比較的故障する確率は高いと言えます。
	ＦＦではエンジンが横置きなので、クルマの室内が広く取れるというメリットがありました。
	逆にＦＲではエンジンが縦置きなので、室内を広くするためには、結局、クルマ自体を大きくするしかありません。
	するとエンジンの回転方向をタイヤに対して９０度の向きで置く必要が出てきます。
	これをシャフトでクルマの後部に伝え、そこでギアを使って再び向きを９０度変えて後輪を回すわけです。

	インフルエンザの種類
	ヒトに感染するインフルエンザウイルスには、Ａ型・Ｂ型・Ｃ型の３つがあり、現在流行の中心となっているのはＡ型とＢ型です。
	Ａ型は症状が重篤になる傾向があり、死に至ることもあります。
	また感染力が強いため、大流行（パンデミック）を起こしやすく、過去には香港かぜやスペインかぜなどの世界的な流行で多くの死者を出しました。
	２００９年に世界中で流行したいわゆる「新型インフルエンザ」は、Ａ型、Ｈ１Ｎ１亜型というものでした。
	Ｂ型は、Ａ型よりも症状が比較的軽く、限られた地域で流行するケースが見られます。
	Ｃ型は鼻かぜ程度の軽い症状ですむことが多いウイルスです。

	インフルエンザの治療
	【一般療法】
	できるだけ安静にし、栄養と十分な睡眠を取ります。
	インフルエンザウイルスの空気中での活動や感染を抑えるために、加湿器などで室内の湿度を５０〜６０％に保ちます。
	水分を十分に補います。
	お茶、スープ、ジュースなど何でもいいので飲みたいものを飲みます。
	【対症療法】
	発熱や関節痛などに対しては解熱鎮痛薬、鼻水やくしゃみに抗ヒスタミン薬などが用いられます。
	一方、インフルエンザの症状はインフルエンザウイルスに対して免疫が正常に働いている結果であり、薬で無理に抑えないほうがよいという考え方もあります。
	市販の薬を自己判断で使用することは、かえって逆効果になる場合があるので、医師の指示にしたがってください。

	・景気は良くなるのか？
	日本の景気が良くなれば、政策金利が上昇することになり、変動金利が高くなります。
	しかし、２０１７年という時点での景気回復は見通しが立っていないのが現状です。
	アベノミクスでの株価上昇というのは経済が良くなったのではなく、為替介入による円安誘導で株価が上がったに過ぎません。
	円安になると輸出企業の多い日本では、株高になるからです。
	日本円というのは不思議な立ち位置で、世界の経済情勢が悪化すると、外国人投資家・機関投資家はすぐに「円買い」に動きます。
	世界的にはまだ「円」は安全な通貨と認識されているのです。
	世界のどこかで経済的な不安を感じさせる事件があれば、すぐに円高になり、株安に戻ってしまうのです。
	為替だけでつくられたまやかしの株高は長くは続かないのです。
	アベノミクスの流れに沿うように商品価格を上げた企業も、続々とデフレ基準の価格に戻しています。
	個人の収入が増えていないのですから「商品価格を上げても売れなくなっただけ」というのがここ２年ぐらいでばれてしまったのです。
	為替に頼らないで景気回復をするためには、構造改革が必要となり、時間を要するのです。
	２０１７年に景気が回復する見通しというのは立たないのです。

	・毛嚢炎のリスク
	カミソリなどの自己処理に比べると毛嚢炎ができる確率は低いですが、ゼロではありません。
	毛穴が少し傷ついただけで毛嚢炎はできることがあります。
	光脱毛では、熱を利用してムダ毛にダメージを与える仕組みなので、毛根周辺の毛包や表皮にも多少の熱ダメージが残ります。
	脱毛施術後の肌は一時的にバリア機能が下がりやすいので、ブドウ球菌がダメージを受けた毛包に入り込んできて、毛嚢炎を引き起こしてしまうことがあります。

	・硬毛化・多毛化
	産毛が濃く硬くなったり、生えていなかった場所から毛が生えることがあります。
	科学的原因はハッキリしていませんが、熱量が関係していると言われています。
	同じ熱量でも太い毛は熱を集めることができるので毛の抑制が上手くいきます。
	一方、産毛などに同じ熱量を照射した場合、メラニン色素が少ないため、熱を毛に上手く届けることができず、結果弱い熱量が毛に届きます。
	これが、成長を活性化させているという説が有力です。

	日焼けした肌が脱毛できない理由
	脱毛機はメラニン（黒いもの）に反応する仕組み→肌が日焼けで黒くなる→毛の黒に反応しにくくなる
	日焼けで肌が乾燥する→痛みを感じやすくなる
	日焼けで肌が黒くなる→メラニンに必要以上に反応して痛みを感じやすくなる
	対策
	小麦肌が好きな方は、夏は特に焼きたいと思うので、夏までに脱毛が完了するよに計算して脱毛を開始しましょう。
	脱毛期間中は日焼けを控えて、脱毛完了後肌が落ち着いてから焼くのがオススメです。
	オススメのコース
	ラヴォーグのスピードパックだと最短半年で全身の脱毛が完了回数の１２回通えます。

	４．ミディアムロング
	ビジネスとしては取り入れにくいが、そのふわっとした髪が女性に人気が高いヘアスタイル。
	ロングヘアは少しＵＰしてマッシュスタイルにすることで綺麗なシルエットになります。
	サイドは軽めのツーブロックでメリハリをつけ、全体は束感を出せるようにセニングカットを施してきましょう。
	パーマは外ハネとニュアンスを組み合わせたミックスパーマがおすすめ。
	髪型のセット方法
	全体に空気を入れるように乾かしていく。
	その後水分を少し含んだ状態でワックスを揉み込む。
	ワックスが馴染んだら、軽く流れを作っていく。
	毛束はほぐさず、少し大きめぐらいにしておく。
	最後に外ハネを作り、スプレーをかければ完成。

	疫病が蔓延してしまったら
	疫病は初期の頃は発祥する葉数が少ないので葉を摘葉して対策することが出来ますが、株全体に疫病が広がってしまった時は、薬剤を使わない場合は株ごと除去するしか手立てはありません。
	マンションなどで数株だけ栽培している時は、株ごと抜き取る事が出来ないことが多いので、その時は薬剤を利用することを検討して下さい。
	生育初期や収穫前の薬剤使用であれば、決められた量と決められた回数を守って使用すれば人体への影響は殆どありません。

	疫病の症状の特徴と見分け方
	疫病の症状と見分け方疫病はどの野菜にも発生する「カビ」による病気で、初期は下葉に水が染みたような病斑が発生し徐々に茎や果実に暗褐色の大きな病斑が発生するようになります。
	疫病が進行すると病斑にうっすらとした白色のカビが生えます。
	特にトマトに良く発生する病気で被害が大きくなります。
	ナスに発生する褐色腐敗病はピーマンやカボチャと同じ疫病菌によるものでナスの果実に発病するとやや凹みがある褐色の病斑となります。

	特許庁によると、商標登録の出願があった後で、手数料が支払われると、申請内容の審査が始まる。
	問題がなければ、６ヶ月程度で商標が登録されるという。
	一方、手数料の支払いがなかったり、（１）申請した商標を使った商品、サービスなどが実現する可能性が低い（２）他人が許可なく著名な名称で出願する（３）「五輪」のような公共性の高い名称を出願する−などに該当すると判断されたりした場合、登録が認められない。
	特許庁は、今回の「ＰＰＡＰ」の商標出願問題について、「個別の案件に関してはコメント差し控える」と回答。
	ただ、こうした審査基準に照らせば、大阪府の企業がピコ太郎側から承諾を得ていない場合、商標登録がされる可能性は低い。

	ひとつは属に含まれる種が少ない「異常型」の生物は失敗したグループであるという見方、もうひとつは中間的な種が絶滅してしまった可能性である。
	ダーウィンが例にあげているのは鳥で、ほかのセキツイ動物から孤立しているのは絶滅によって説明できると言う。

	古代ギリシアのアリストテレスは『動物誌』で動物を有血動物と無血動物に大別し有血動物は哺乳類鳥類卵生四足類魚類の四種類無血動物は軟体類甲殻類昆虫類有殻類から構成されると分類していた。
	有血動物は現在の脊椎動物無血動物は無脊椎動物に相当する。
	現在は界門綱目科属種の分類単位がおかれている。
	各階層の他に必要な場合には中間の階層を置くことがある。
	この場合のには「亜」をつけ亜目・亜科などとする。
	たとえばヒトの分類学的位置は動物界脊つい動物門ほ乳綱サル目（霊長目）ヒト科ヒト亜科ヒト属のヒトである。
	学名はＨｏｍｏｓａｐｉｅｎｓＬＩＮＮＡＥＵＳ１７５８である。
	類人猿もヒト科に含まれヒト科とサルの仲間がサル目に含まれる。
	分類の階層を上がるほど違いが大きくなる。
	なお近年は界より上にドメイン（ｄｏｍａｉｎ）を設ける場合がある。

	１．Ｊａｖａとは
	・どんな言語か
	ここしばらくＴＩＯＢＥのランキングで１位を取っている有名言語。
	でも親会社はドナドナされた。
	中間コードにコンパイルされＶＭ上で動作するので移植性が高く、Ｗｅｂ系や組込み系、Ａｎｄｒｏｉｄなど幅広い分野で利用されている。
	でも親会社はドナドナされた。
	そんな言語も今ではプロプライエタリの申し子であるＯｒａｃｌｅさんの持ち物となり、今後どうなっていくかは今ひとつ不透明ドナ。
	・長所
	実行速度はＣに及ばないもののスクリプト言語よりは数十倍速い。
	ガベージコレクション付き言語の中では最速クラス。
	下位互換とクロスプラットフォームが割としっかりしているので、一度コードを書けばそれが広い範囲で長期間利用できる。
	Ｊａｖａ１．４で書かれたライブラリが今でも普通にＪａｖａ６から呼ばれていたりするみたいな。
	・短所
	ＶＭを立ち上げるのに時間がかかるので、一瞬で終わる軽い処理を実行する場合はどの言語よりももっさりした動きになる。
	名前空間とか、型の宣言とか、かなり厳密にやらないといけない。
	ダックタイピングなんてお行儀の悪いこともできない。
	ちゃんとインターフェース書きなさい、とな。
	バグを防ぐという意味では厳密さはありがたくもあるけど、コード量は多くなるしディレクトリ構造は複雑になるので、コードを書く時はＩＤＥがないとやってられない。

	・長所
	Ｊａｖａ並の実行速度とＲｕｂｙ並の書きやすさが合わさり最強に見える。
	Ｊａｖａの資産が使い放題で、Ｅｒｌａｎｇのような並列処理まで合わせ持つのでもう手に負えない。
	コードの量もその辺のスクリプト言語並に短くて済む。
	・短所
	覚えるのにけっこう時間がかかる。
	ＣやＣ＋＋ほどではないけどＪａｖａよりも難易度高め。

	シャープ設定の調整（続き）
	次の２つのシャープ設定は重要です。
	半径では、写真にシャープを適用する際のディテールの細かさを指定します。
	半径の値を小さくすると、ディテールの細かいものが多い風景などの写真が美しく仕上がります。
	静物や人物など、それほどディテールの細かくない写真では、半径の値は大きい方が適しています。
	サンプルの写真は、半径が１．０に設定されています。
	ディテールでは、写真の中でエッジを強調する度合いを指定します。
	ディテールの値が高いほどテクスチャの輪郭がはっきりし、値が低いほどピンぼけがなくなります。
	サンプルの写真は、ディテールが２５に設定されています。

	農地売買の大まかな流れ
	どのような農地売買でも、売買契約は農業委員会の許可を前提として締結されます。
	農地として売るなら農地法第３条による売買（所有権移転）許可、農地以外で売るなら農地法第５条による転用許可です（届出の場合もあります）。
	農地売買では、通常の不動産取引ではあまりない、「仮登記」を行うのが通常です。
	許可を条件とした売買契約を締結
	農業委員会に許可申請
	許可前に所有権移転請求権仮登記
	許可後に代金支払いと所有権移転登記（本登記）
	２．の農業委員会への許可申請と３．の仮登記は、順番が前後することに問題はなく、どちらも売買契約締結後、遅滞なく行う条項を１．の売買契約書に盛り込みます。
	また、３．仮登記は売買契約の絶対条件ではないですが、４．の許可まで買主が所有権を得られないために、買主による将来の確実な所有権移転を保全する目的で行われます。
	許可されると農業委員会から許可指令書が交付され、許可指令書がなければ農地の所有権移転登記は受け付けてもらえません。
	許可のない違法な所有権移転を防ぐために、このような仕組みになっています。

	転用して売買する場合の注意点
	農地転用には２種類あります。
	農地の所有者が自ら農地以外の用途で使用する目的
	他者への売買を目的
	農地の所有者が自ら使用するための転用は、農地法４条による転用許可で、売買が目的の農地法５条による転用許可とは扱いが異なります。
	ただ、最終的に他者へ売却するのなら、２つの違いは転用のタイミングに過ぎません。
	先に転用してから売却するか、売却と同時に転用するかという違いです。
	転用はどちらが先でも同じように思えますが、転用許可の制度上、単に転用する許可申請は認められず、転用後の事業計画を必要とします。
	例えば、「とりあえず農地から宅地や雑種地にしておき、後から買主が現れるまで待つ」というような転用許可申請は認められません。

	農地売買の手数料
	農地として売る場合、個人間売買や農業関連機関の斡旋（あっせん）を利用する形態が主で、手数料は登記費用（登録免許税や司法書士報酬）くらいしか発生しません。
	転用による売買では、不動産会社に仲介依頼して売買できるので、登記費用の他にも不動産会社に対して仲介手数料を支払います。
	転用による売買では、転用前提であることを明示すれば、転用許可後に地目変更できるので、農地であっても宅地や雑種地同様に買いやすく、広く買主を探せます。
	したがって、売買価格も農地のまま売るよりも高くなることが想定され、不動産会社への仲介手数料も多くなります。

	まずタンギングですが、バリトンの場合、クラシック的なきれいな発音を意識しすぎると低音域の輪郭がぼやけがちになります。
	従って、自分で「少しアタックが強すぎるかな？」と思うくらいのタンギングをしたほうが良いでしょう。
	ただ、むやみやたらに強くすると逆効果ですので、練習が必要です。

	あとバリトンの場合、マウスピースも違ってきます。
	アルト等で使われるセルマーＣ＊だと狭すぎます。
	クラシックの場合でもセルマーだったらＤ〜Ｅ。
	Ｓ９０でしたら１２０。
	ヤナギサワ等ならば７番くらいのモノをお薦めします。
	もっともこれは演奏者の体格、体力次第ですので、必要以上に番号の大きなモノを使っても意味がありません。
	それでも、ある程度のティップ・オープニング（くわえるところの広さ）があるとバリトンの場合劇的に楽になる場合があります。
	色々試してみて下さい。

	方法２：「思いこみ」の範囲を限定する
	日常生活のささいな思いこみが、普遍的な法則だったなんてことはありません。
	かならずそこには「範囲」があるのです。
	思い込みの適応範囲を一部に限定していきましょう。
	時間、場所、状態、人、環境などあらゆる側面から限定していくのです。
	「小学校の時はバカだったかもしれないが、社会人となり家庭を築いている私はもうバカではない」
	これも紙やパソコンにどんどん書いていき、読み上げましょう。
	「昔＋あの場所＋あの時の自分＋特定の人」という条件でたまたま感じたことを、真実のように信じこむのはおかしいことに気がつくでしょう。

	？浪人し受験に失敗した人の多くが英語を得意科目にできなかった人です。
	英語は配点が高いから重要。
	これが受験生の理解ですが実際にはもう少し深い要素があります。
	それは英語が唯一の「真の積み重ね型の教科」ということです。
	地歴公民は中学校でも習いますが、高校では初めからもう一度習います。
	例えば日本史なら高校で改めて縄文時代から学び直します。
	理科も同様です。
	国語は中学のときに苦手科目であっても、高校から力を入れれば伸びてきます（漢検３級程度の基礎は必要）。
	数学は積み重ねの要素が多少ありますが、英語ほどではなく挽回が可能です。
	？一方英語は中３や高１で苦手教科だった場合には、浪人して人並み勉強をしても苦手が改善されない科目です。
	人の３倍程度勉強時間をとってもなお変化はありません。
	「真の積み重ね型の教科」である英語は、基礎が不十分な場合、スタート時の偏差値が５０ならずっと５０のまま、４５ならずっと４５のまま終わることが多い、逆転が難しい科目です。

	報告書内容の注意点
	１．内容に欠落がないか
	報告書においては、内容に欠落があっては、役に立ちません。
	まず、数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）、固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）、単位（千、万、円、ドル、グラム、Ｋｇ等）、相手の意志（反対する、賛成する、購入する、購入しない等）を報告書から漏らしてはいけません。
	読み手に「悟ってもらう」事はありえません。
	ビジネス文書では相手は、自分の文章を「最も批判的に読む」と考えるべきです。
	自分に都合良く、相手が解釈してくれることは絶対にありえません。
	報告書を書き上げたら、妥当かどうかを確認してください。
	２．内容に誤認がないか
	・数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）
	・固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）
	・単位（千、万、円、ドル等）
	・相手の意志（反対、賛成、購入する、購入しない等）
	を勝手に解釈して、事実誤認しないこと。
	誤認によって、今後の動きが違ってくる可能性があるので、事実を正確に把握することはきわめて重要です。
	これを防ぐには、メモを取るときに、重要だと思う点にサインをつけておき、商談・会議の終わりに再確認するのが望ましいと思います。

	ミントの苗選びのコツは、ひょろっと長いものよりも株元から何本も芽が出ている株を選びましょう。
	また地面の近くの下葉の裏をみて斑点状に変色していないものや虫が付いていないかも確認して下さい。
	植え付け時期はハーブ苗が出回る時期に合わせ、だいたい真冬と真夏は避ければいつでも大丈夫です。
	鉢選びと植え付けのコツ
	ミントは地植えと鉢植えの両方できますが生育旺盛で根も張るため植える鉢も大きめの鉢を選ぶ必要があります。
	目安として、市販されている黒いビニールポット３号ポット（直径９ｃｍ）に植えられている苗の場合５〜６号鉢（直径１８ｃｍ）くらいを選びましょう。
	植え付ける土は保湿性のあるハーブ専用培養土か肥料が配合されている野菜栽培用などの培養土を選んでください。
	ミントを植えるときに注意したいのは混植してはいけません。
	ミントは繁殖力が強いため一緒に植えてもミントだらけになってしまい他の植物を枯らしてしまいます。
	また、ミント同士でも種間交雑をしてしまうため１鉢１品種で栽培しましょう。
	水やりと肥料
	ミントは乾燥に弱いので鉢の表面が乾いたら鉢底から水が流れ出るまで水をあげて下さい。
	また肥料に関しては基本的に植え付け時に肥料入りの培養土で植え付けたのなら追肥はあまり必要ありません。
	葉色が黄色くなってきたり葉数を増やしたい場合は固形もしくは液体の肥料を肥料の容器に書かれている用法容量に従って与えて下さい。

	『心配事の９割は起こらない』なんて本が話題になりましたが、実際アメリカで行われた研究の結果、「心配したことの“８５％”は、結局“いい結果”か“良くも悪くもない中立の結果”に終わる」んだとか。
	また、実際に心配事が現実になってしまった場合でも、約８割の人が「自分が想像していたよりも上手く出来事に対処できた！」と語っているそうです。
	「不安はそもそも現実にならないし、もしそうなっても何とかなる！」と科学的に証明されているのはなんだか心強いですね。
	心が押しつぶされてしまいそうな時は、ぜひこの結果を思い出してみて。

	設問の流れとしては、消費者が商品を知ったきっかけ〜購入にいたるプロセス、購入後の満足度、今後の継続意向という順に聞くことが一般的です。
	回答者が思い起こしやすいよう、時系列をあわせる。
	また満足度については、先に総合満足度を聞き、その後に詳細満足度を聞くことがセオリーです。
	掘り下げていくような設問設計をする場合は、まずは総合的・一般的な質問をし、その後に詳細を聞くようにしましょう。
	※詳細満足度を先に聞くと、その内容が回答者の頭に入り総合満足度の結果が変わってしまう（バイアスがかかる）ことにつながります。

	また、複雑なアンケートの場合、ページ数が多くなりがちです。
	ページ数や設問数が多いと、何問答えれば終わるのかがわからず回答者が不安になり、離脱しやすくなります。
	対策として、アンケートフォームの右上などに「現在のページ数」と「全体のページ数」を記載しておくと、回答者に安心感を与えることができます。

	上述した通り、おすすめは単一選択型（ＳＡ）です。
	単一選択型の場合、回答者は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	答えやすくなる理由は、「すでに用意された選択肢のなかから、どれかひとつを選ぶだけで済む」ためです。
	自由回答型（ＦＡ）の項目の場合、回答者はゼロから記載する内容を考えざるを得なくなるので、圧倒的に回答ハードルは高くなります。

	３答えやすい質問・内容になればなるほど、回答率は上がる
	答えやすいアンケートを作成するために、「ターゲット」に合わせた口調で調査票の文章を設計しましょう。
	ポイントは、「わかりやすい文章」「ターゲット」「専門用語」「対象」「時期」「回答形式（単一選択型）」です。
	「わかりやすい文章」で質問文を書く
	意識的に、一文の長さを短めに設計すると端的でわかりやすくなります。
	また、「ターゲット」が取引先のお客様であれば、その業界に特有の「専門用語」などは通じますが、一般消費者がターゲットの場合は平易な日本語に置き換える、など工夫も必要です。
	「対象（誰、どこ、何についての質問なのか）」について明確にする
	「時期（過去・現在・未来）」を明確にする
	「回答形式」は「単一選択型」がおすすめ
	単一選択型の回答形式は、回答する側は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	回答形式については、詳細を後述します。

	アンケートには、「紙で行う場合」と「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行う場合」がありますが、弊社では、回答者がネット環境に接続できない理由がある（たとえばターゲットが高齢者のみの場合など）といった特殊なケース以外では、「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行うアンケート」をおすすめしています。
	アンケートの作成・データ収集・集計など、アンケート業務のほとんどのプロセスにおいて、業務を効率化できコストダウンも図れるためです。
	たとえば、弊社のクラウドサービスＳｙｎｅｒｇｙ！３６０の場合、回答内容によって異なる設問（ページ）へフォームを分岐できるので、Ｗｅｂフォームを活用すれば回答者の負担軽減も可能になり、回答率の向上が図れます。
	「問１にＡと回答した人は問３のページへ飛ぶ、Ｂと回答した人は問５のページへ飛ぶ」のような「設問の条件分岐」の設定が簡単に実現できます。

	体にウイルスなどの敵が侵入すると、白血球内のリンパ球に存在する免疫細胞が、攻撃をしかけて撃退します。
	このときに抗体を作り、再び同じ敵が侵入してきたときのために備えます。
	この抗体が「ＩｇＥ抗体」と呼ばれるもので、花粉を敵と勘違いして、花粉に接触する度に「ＩｇＥ抗体」が作られて体内に蓄積され、ある水準を超えると花粉症として発症します。
	また、免疫細胞である「Ｔｈ１細胞」と「Ｔｈ２細胞」も、花粉症を発生させる原因のひとつといわれています。
	その仕組みは、アレルギー反応を促す「Ｔｈ２細胞」と、それを見張ってアレルギー反応を抑える「Ｔｈ１細胞」のバランスが崩れることで、花粉症などのアレルギーが発症するというものです。

	更年期障害の場合は、閉経の前後に女性ホルモンのバランスの変化により、だるさや疲れ、不眠などの症状が出ます。
	さらに大きな病気の前触れとして、うつ病や心身症などの精神疾患や、慢性肝炎や肝硬変などの肝臓の疾患、胃がん、大腸がん、糖尿病、結核、慢性腎盂腎炎などの症状としてだるさや倦怠感が現れることもあります。
	疲労からなりやすいと言われるうつ病は、特別な疾患はないにも関わらず、だるさが続き、気力が低下したり、落ち込むことがあります。
	だるさや倦怠感を感じた場合、まず休養を取ることが大切ですが、なかなか回復しない場合は他の病気の可能性はないかと疑うことも必要です。

	内科の病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感
	内科の病気の症状が現れる前に、疲労感が現れることもあります。
	時間が経つとそれぞれの病気が持つ特徴的な症状が現れますが、それまでの病気がまだ分かっていない間に疲労感は現れます。
	精神的なストレスの蓄積や過労、睡眠不足、心配事などが原因で、軽いうつ病の症状として疲労感を感じることがあります。
	また、自律神経障害の症状として疲労感が生じることもあります。
	また、立ち仕事やパソコン業務の長時間労働などにより肉体的な疲労感を感じることもあります。
	同じ姿勢で長時間いることで一部の筋肉しか使われず、特定の筋肉のこりを生じやすいからです。
	筋肉のこりは肩や首、頭部にかけて生じることが多いため、頭痛やめまい、目の奥が痛むなどの症状が現れることがあります。
	他にも、睡眠時無呼吸症候群や慢性疲労症候群、潜在的ビタミンＢ１欠乏症、糖尿病などの病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感もあります。
	回復しないだるさや倦怠感がある場合は、重大な病気が潜んでいることもあるので、病院で診てもらう必要があります。
	また、定期的に人間ドッグなどの健康診断を受けることも大切です。

	花粉症の改善に効果が期待できるとして注目される代表的な乳酸菌とビフィズス菌には、以下のようなものがあります。
	●フェカリス菌
	加熱殺菌して死滅した状態で摂取しても高い効果が得られる新型乳酸菌。
	スギ花粉症患者２０名に曝露（ばくろ）室で人工的に一定量の花粉を浴びてもらい、その後、フェカリス菌入り乳性飲料を１日１本２か月間飲用後にも同じ実験を実施。
	飲む前と後では、鼻かみ回数や目のかゆみなどが減り、アレルギー症状が改善する傾向が認められました。
	●Ｌ−９２乳酸菌
	花粉症にかかった人を対象に、一定期間にわたってＬ−９２乳酸菌を摂取してもらったところ、
	アレルギーの原因となる「Ｔｈ２細胞」を活性化する物質が抑えられました。
	その結果、花粉症の改善に効果があることが立証されました。
	●ＫＷ乳酸菌
	花粉症患者９６人にＫＷ乳酸菌の粉末を摂取してもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善。
	また、マウスによる実験において、血中のＩｇＥ濃度が低下し、Ｔｈ２細胞とＴｈ１細胞のバランスが改善されたことも報告されています。
	●ビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６
	スギ花粉が飛び始める約１か月前から１３週間にわたって、花粉症患者４４名にビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６粉末を飲んでもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善されたという実験結果が報告されています。
	以上は代表的なものですが、今後もさらに注目の新しい菌が発見される可能性もあります。

	良質なタンパク質、ビタミンやミネラルが豊富に含まれた食材を使った、バランスのよい食事を心掛けましょう。
	そのほか、一時的な疲労回復には糖分が役立ちますが、とりすぎるとかえって身体がだるくなることもありますので気を付けてくださいね。

	実はブラックとネイビー無地は悪い意味でシンプルになりがちです。
	スーツスタイルのコーディネート配色のポイントの１つがコントラストをつけすぎないことです。
	グレーに比べブラックやネイビーはコーディネートでよく使われる白シャツとのコントラストが強まり、フォーマル寄りのイメージが強まります。
	するとシンプルなイメージが強まり、毎回同じコーディネートに見られたり地味な印象を受けられやすくなります。
	そのため就活生っぽく見えてしまったり、素材の良し悪しの影響やコーディネートが似た印象になり、いまいちパッとしないイメージになりがちです。
	抽象的ですがビジネスシーンではフォーマルすぎないバランスが大事になってきます。
	そのフォーマルすぎないバランスを取れる色がグレー系と柄ありのネイビーになるのです。
	白シャツと合わせてもコントラストが低いので、良い意味で自然にぼやけてくれてネクタイの合わせやすさや優しい印象に繋がります。
	コーディネートのしやすさと地味すぎない適度な華やかさを考慮すると上の３種類に定まってきます。
	生地は基本的にウール１００％で探すのをオススメします。

	パソコン本体を見ると、ハードディスクの動作を示すランプがちかちか不規則に点滅しているはずです。
	場合によっては起動ができるまで辛抱強く待ちましょう。
	ただし、毎回起動時に真っ黒画面が続くようであれば異常が考えられますので、専門家にご相談ください。
	一方で問題が発生している場合は、コンピューターはどんな異常が発生しているのかを利用者に知らせるようにできています。
	これには、画面が真っ青になって（ブルースクリーンといいます）英語で異常報告が行われる場合と、黒い画面に異常報告がおこなわれる場合があります。
	これらの異常報告画面が表示されたときには、専門家でない限り、手出しはしない方がよいでしょう。
	可能ならば異常報告画面を記録しておき、メーカーやお店のサポートいった専門家に相談しましょう。
