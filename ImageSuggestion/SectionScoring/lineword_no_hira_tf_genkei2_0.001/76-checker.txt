	バリトンボイスが一番聞き心地がイイ・・・とどこかで聞いたことがある。

	優しく包み込むオブラートのような声の人もいれば、歌手の和田アキ子さんのように男性的な声の人もいる。
	代表的な声楽家には、ＮａｔｈａｌｉｅＳｔｕｔｚｍａｎｎがいる。
	ＮａｔｈａｌｉｅＳｔｕｔｚｍａｎｎは本物のアルト歌手だ。
	アルトは、ソプラノとかのように声質によって細分化されることは特にない気がする。
	そもそも、日本人のアルト歌手自体希少である。
	人によってはテノールの低いほうの音域まで出せる。
	とあるアルト歌手は、合唱でテノールを担当したことがあるらしい。
	また、合唱などでは、
	ソプラノに対して低い旋律を受け持つパートのことを意味することが多いが、
	その場合は声種でいうところのアルトとは別物と考えるべきだろう。
	男声が歌う女声（男声アルト）のことをカウンターテナー（後述）という。
	テノール
	テノールは、基本的にテンションの高いイメージがある。
	若さや勇ましさ、潔さや清楚さなどを表現するにふさわしい声種だろう。
	個人的には、王子様といったイメージも少なからずあるが、
	神がかった上品で崇高なテノールには脳内までもが痺れてくる。

	バス
	女声のアルトと同じく、日本人では希少である。
	これも細分化されないと思う。
	バスバリトンと比べても声域はほぼ変わらないが、
	より深く厚く、地を這ってくるような感じがする。
	王様や悪魔など、偉大なる役柄を演じる上で適しているかもしれない。
	バス歌手には体もデカい人が多く、舞台映えも半端ない気がする。
	少し古い人でイギリスのバロック声楽家ＤａｖｉｄＴｈｏｍａｓ（アメリカの歌手とは別人）がいるが、
	彼はバス歌手の割に威圧感がなく、私としては割と好きな声だ。
	その他の声種
	以上では、６つの声種を細分化して分類してみました。
	細分化の仕方や、それぞれの明確な定義はけっこう曖昧だったりしますが、
	まあ、だいたいこんな感じです！
	ってことで、参考にしてみてください♪
	では、最後に、特種なものを・・・。
	・カウンターテナー
	・カストラート
	このふたつです。
	では、説明していきましょう！

	カウンターテナー（含ソプラニスタ）
	裏声をうまく活用し駆使した、男性が出す女声のこと。
	声量はやや劣るが、神々しくデリケートな声で、時に女声よりも艶やか。
	カウンターテノール、コントラテノーレ、男声アルトや男声ソプラノともいう。
	テノールの一種とも捉えられるが、発声法は大きく異なる。
	基本的に声域はアルトとほぼ同じで、
	人によってはメゾソプラノやソプラノの声域を得意とする。
	ソプラノのカウンターテナーのことをソプラニスタと呼んだりするが、
	岡本知高氏のごとく、声変わりを経ずにソプラノ声のままの人も稀に存在する。
	この場合、後述のカストラート同様、男性としての声量によるソプラノを聴くことができる。
	また、アルトより低く、
	テノールの声域を担うフランスのカウンターテナーをオートコントルと呼ぶこともある。
	これは、極度に高いテノールとも捉えることができる。
	カウンターテナーは、
	基本的にルネサンスやバロックの音楽で活躍するが、
	現代ではオペラでメゾソプラノの役を担ったりすることも多くなっている。
	カストラート
	男性を去勢し、男性ホルモンの分泌を不可能にすることで、
	声変わり前の高い声を人為的に保った声種。
	成長ホルモンは分泌され続けるため、身体だけは大きくなるが、
	声はソプラノのままの声であり、力強く、野生的で官能的なソプラノ声
	を持つようだ。
	１７〜１８世紀のヨーロッパで最盛期を迎えたが、
	１９世紀半ばにローマ教皇によって、人道的・倫理的な理由で禁止にされた。
	史上最後のカストラート歌手は、アレッサンドロ・モレスキ氏で。
	世に録音が残っているので、興味があったら是非聴いてみてほしい。
	カウンターテナーの寄せ集めＣＤ『ＡＬＴＵＳ奇跡の声』に、
	一曲だけモレスキ氏の貴重な歌声が収録されている。

	今回は声種に関するお話でしたが、いかがでしたか？
	今回ご説明した内容は、必ずこう定義されている！！というわけではないので、
	軽い気持ちで参考にしていただけたら幸いです。
	あなたはどんな声種ですか？？
	日本人って、普段はけっこう不自然な声で喋っていたりするので、
	本当の自分の声が何なのか、まだ分からない方も多いと思います。
	リラックスして正しい発声法で発する素の声こそ、あなたの本当の声♪
	一回それを見つけてみてはいかがでしょうか？
	今日は、ここまでにしたいと思います。
	長くなりましたが、ここまで読んでくださりありがとうございます！☆

	●コロラトゥーラソプラノ
	コロコロと転がったり跳躍する旋律を専門とするソプラノ。
	同じ人間の声帯とは思えぬほど、超技巧的。
	曲例としては、モーツァルトの「夜の女王のアリア」（『魔笛』）がある。
	●ソプラノ・レッジェーロ
	軽やかで可憐な声。
	かわいらしく、愛おしい。
	高音や技巧的節回しが得意。
	個人的には、バロック声楽家のＥｍｍａＫｉｒｋｂｙがこの部類だと思う。
	●ソプラノ・リリコ・レッジェーロ
	レッジェーロよりは幾分落ち着いた、甘くて優美な声。
	高音域のみならず中音域もいける。
	●ソプラノ・リリコ
	最も一般的なソプラノと思われる。
	リリコという文字通り、叙情的な声。
	高い声が出せるが、中音域も充実。
	●ソプラノ・リリコ・スピント
	リリコより深く、太めの声。
	重量感があり、力強い印象。
	●ソプラノ・ドラマティコ
	ドラマチックな表現が得意なソプラノで、
	高音はもちろん、低音までをカバーし、太くエネルギッシュな声。
	真っ先に思い浮かぶは、ＪｅｓｓｙｅＮｏｒｍａｎ。
	メゾソプラノ
	大人びた女性らしさ、艶やかさや色気、
	そして包容力や母性を醸し出す上で適している声種だろう。
	オペラなどでは、少年役や魔女役を担当することもある。

	それでは、ひとつずつみていきましょう！
	説明は主観的で、私自身の偏見もちょっとだけ含まれておりますのであしからず笑
	ソプラノ
	女性としてのかわいらしさや若さ・幼さ、崇高さ、
	そして愛おしさや明るさの表現に適す声域のように思う。
	日本のアイドルとか可愛い系タレントはソプラノのイメージが強い。
	元々声が低い女性でも、男に媚びるとソプラノになったりするから不思議だ。
