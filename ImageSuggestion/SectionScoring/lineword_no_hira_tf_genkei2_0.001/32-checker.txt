	・自分のことを話したい、伝えたい。

	相手「７」自分「３」の割合です。
	ステップ１で書き出した内容を話の中でさりげなく混ぜてあげられると最高です。

	理由３：怒られても、けなされても成長できるひとは、あなたのことを必要としていない。
	出来ないから罵倒する、失敗したから責め立てる。
	仕事などでしかたの無い時もありますが、それは本当にそのひとの事を考えて行こなっている事でしょうか？あなた自身の保身の為だったり、ストレス発散、誰かを踏みつけること、ひとを上から見下ろす事の優越感に浸っているだけ、、、ということはありませんか？
	怒られている人、虐げられているひとは、口にはださなくても、相手が本当はどんな気持ちで、そんな行為行動を行っているのか、案外気がついているもの。
	つまらない優越感の為にひとを誹謗中傷したり、踏みにじるのは、悲しいだけですから、もう終わりにしましょう。
	罵倒されて、成長するひと、踏みにじられて成長するひとは、あなたに言われなくてもひとりで成長できます。
	だって、それに負けないエネルギーを持っているのですから。
	そしてその人が成長した時には、あなたはもう必要ないと思われるでしょう、もしあなただけが「２人は良い関係だ」と勘違いしていたら、そのひとは確実にあなたのもとを去っていきます。
	では、ほめて相手が成長した場合はどうかというと、仕事・恋愛・プライベートでも、きっと良い関係になっているはず、成長したからあなたは必要なくなる？そんな訳ありませんよね。
	ほら、ほめ上手になると、生活が凄く充実していくのがわかりますよね。
	では、次はどうすれば相手の良いところを見つけて、ほめ上手になり、人間関係を劇的に改善できるかについて話を進めます。

	一口にコミュニケーションと言っても、範囲が広すぎて、何が何なのか、わからないですよね。
	ここでいうコミュニケーションというのは主に以下の３つのこと
	・相手への気遣い
	・相手への尊敬
	・相手を認めてあげること
	これらが足りなくなると、よっぽどの理由がないかぎり、相手との関係は崩壊します。
	考えてみてください、もしあなたの目の前にいる人が、あなたに対して
	・自分の意見ばかりを押し通そうとしたりして、あなたにはまったく気を使わない
	・あなたの事を、なんだこいつ？といった感じで見下している
	・あなたの事をどうせ、ダメだろ。
	出来る訳ない。
	などと決めつけている
	としたら、あなたは相手に対してどう思いますか？当然良い気分ではないでしょうし、一緒に居たいとは思いませんよね。

	でも、もしこれを、あなたが無意識に相手に対して行ってしまっていたら、、、、怖いですよね。
	だから、こうしましょう。
	相手をほめる
	たったこれだけで、人間関係は驚くほど好転します。
	なんだよ、へりくだって、相手にごまをすれって事かよ！などと勘違いせずにしっかりと聞いてください、下心を持って相手に何かしてもらう為にほめるのではなく、相手の良い部分を探して、相手が気を使っている部分を見つけて、それを口に出してほめてあげるんです。
	人間１００％カッコいい、１００％完璧なひとなんて誰ひとり存在しません。
	私もそうですし、これを読んでいるあなたもそうです、良いところがあれば、必ず悪いところもあります。
	ひとあらを探して突くのは簡単ですが、突いたひと意外は誰も良い気持ちになりませんし、誰も得しません。
	でも、良い部分を探してほめてあげれば、ほめられたひとは嬉しくなって、もっとがんばるでしょうし、ほめた本人だって、ちょっといい気持ちになっているもの。

	ひとは誰しもが「認めて欲しい」「尊敬してほしい」「感謝してほしい」という３つの要求を持っています、ほめたり励ましたりというのはこの欲求に対してドストライクではまります。
	ですから、ほめ上手なひとは、自然とまわりにひとがたくさん集まってくるのです。
	だってそうでしょう、いつもほめてくれるひとと、いつもケチばかりつけてくるひと、あなたはどっちのひとと一緒に居たいと思います？

	ほめ上手は人生が充実している
	こんなにうまくいく３つの理由
	理由１：ほめるのが上手なひとは、間違いなく異性にモテる
	女性にモテる男性は女性への気遣いがもの凄くじょうずです。
	・さりげなく、アクセサリーや洋服をほめてあげたり、
	・髪型やお化粧の小さな変化に気がついてあげる。
	・お店では、ごく自然にレディーファーストで上着やコートをかけてあげる。
	そういったことをモテる男性は、いつも当たり前にやっています。
	なので相手の女性からしたら、「この人は、わたしを大切にしてくれる」「このひとと一緒にいると心地よい」と感じる
	見た目がカッコいいとか、あのひと面白い、なんて言うのとは全く別の次元で、
	ほめ上手な男性はごく自然に女性の心をつかむことができるんです。
	男性にモテる女性にも同じです。
	・男が見栄を張りたい時に、一歩引いて背中を押して応援してくれる、
	・つまらない仕事や過去の自慢をニコニコ笑顔で聞いて、
	「すごいね」とほめてくれる。
	・ちいさな変化を見逃さずに、フォローしてくれる気遣いがある
	こんなふうにされたら、おとこなら誰だって気分が良くなっちゃいますよね。
	男性と同じでほめ上手な女性は、見た目が可愛い、キレイ、スタイルがうんぬん、なんて言うのは置いておいて
