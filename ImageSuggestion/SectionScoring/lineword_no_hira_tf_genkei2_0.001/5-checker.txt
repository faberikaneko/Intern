	国債金利は
	国債の買い手が増える→国債金利が下がる
	国債の売り手が増える→国債金利が上がる
	という関係にあります。
	買う人が増えると、金利が小さくても売れるため、国債の金利が下がるのです。
	逆に売り手が多くて、買い手が少ない状況だと、金利を高く設定しないと売れないため、国債金利が上がるのです。

	・景気は良くなるのか？
	日本の景気が良くなれば、政策金利が上昇することになり、変動金利が高くなります。
	しかし、２０１７年という時点での景気回復は見通しが立っていないのが現状です。
	アベノミクスでの株価上昇というのは経済が良くなったのではなく、為替介入による円安誘導で株価が上がったに過ぎません。
	円安になると輸出企業の多い日本では、株高になるからです。
	日本円というのは不思議な立ち位置で、世界の経済情勢が悪化すると、外国人投資家・機関投資家はすぐに「円買い」に動きます。
	世界的にはまだ「円」は安全な通貨と認識されているのです。
	世界のどこかで経済的な不安を感じさせる事件があれば、すぐに円高になり、株安に戻ってしまうのです。
	為替だけでつくられたまやかしの株高は長くは続かないのです。
	アベノミクスの流れに沿うように商品価格を上げた企業も、続々とデフレ基準の価格に戻しています。
	個人の収入が増えていないのですから「商品価格を上げても売れなくなっただけ」というのがここ２年ぐらいでばれてしまったのです。
	為替に頼らないで景気回復をするためには、構造改革が必要となり、時間を要するのです。
	２０１７年に景気が回復する見通しというのは立たないのです。

	これ以上マイナス金利になれば、個人が銀行に預ける預金がマイナス金利になったり、海外のように口座管理手数料が発生したり、する可能性もあるのです。
	当然、こうなれば家計への影響は絶大であり、さらに消費を冷え込ませる要因にもなりかねないのです。
	・マイナス金利拡大を日銀が推し進めざるをえない理由
	国債買入れの量的緩和も限界。
	うち手がない
	マイナス金利を導入する前から、物価目標を達成するために、国債を日銀が買い取ることで市場に出回るお金を増やしてインフレ誘導をしてきたのです。
	しかし、円高・株安という流れには抗えずに、結果が全然ついてこないという状況があり、マイナス金利を導入したのです。
	国債を買い取る予算にも限界がありますし、効果もほとんど発揮しないことが証明されてしまったため、国債買入れは続けると明言されているものの、限界に達していることは明らかなのです。
	そのため、マイナス金利拡大も視野に入れているのです。

	・変動金利はそれほど変わっていない事実
	変動金利→政策金利と連動します。
	政策金利によって銀行は日銀から資金を調達して、住宅ローンで融資して利ザヤを稼ぐビジネスモデルですから、政策金利が変動金利と連動するのです。

	結果として、２０１６年は年末にかけて
	ドル高／円安→株高→国債金利上昇→住宅ローン金利上昇
	という動きが出ています。
	とはいえ、このまま住宅ローン金利が上昇するかというとそうではありません。
	トランプ大統領就任による期待値込みのご祝儀相場でドル高になっているだけ
	国債金利上昇で企業への融資が冷え込むのは日本政府はなんとしても避けたいので国債買入れを増強して金利を下げさせる
	金利ターゲットがあるので、国債金利も０．０％ぐらいに着地させるはず
	たしかに株価は上がっていますが、日本の景気とは関係のないところで上がっただけですから、住宅ローン金利が上昇する根本的な要因にはなっていません。

	２０１６年６月に英国でＥＵ離脱の国民投票が行われ「離脱」が５２％で勝利をしました。
	英国はＥＵ加盟による移民の受け入れで、自国民の失業率が増え、低所得層に不満が高まってしまったことがこの結果を招いたのです。
	ＥＵに参加していることで、ＥＵ内でのビジネスや人、お金の移動がスムーズになりそれが経済的にプラスになっている側面もありながら、自国の利益が脅かされていると考える人が多いのです。
	実際には、この現象は英国だけではないのです。
	フランスでも、ドイツでも、「ＥＵに多額の予算を払って、他の貧しいＥＵ参加国の面倒を見るのはおかしい。」と考える方がかなりの数いるのです。
	今回の英国国民投票の結果は、他のＥＵ参加国のＥＵ離脱推進派に勢いを与えるものであり、同じような事例が増える可能性があるのです。

	１要件事実論とは
	Ｑ．要件事実論とはどのようなものでしょうか。
	ポイント
	１．民法、商法、所得税法や法人税法のような実体法では、事実の存在が証明できない場合にどのように条文を適用するのか不明である。
	２．事実の証明についての基準を考えるのが「要件事実論」である。
	３．要件事実論により再構成した実体法が「裁判規範としての法律」となり、訴訟に当たっての重要な拠り所となる。
	Ａ．
	１問題の所在
	民事上の紛争が生じた場合、裁判官は、紛争当事者から出された主張に対して民法や商法などの実体法に照らして判断し、判決を下すことにより解決することになります。
	ここでいう実体法とは、紛争を解決するに際して人々の権利義務を判断するために照らしてみる法律のことを指します。
	すなわち、実体法とは裁判官が訴訟に当たって判断を下すための基準となるわけです。
	ところが、実体法の規定では、必ずしも裁判においてどのように適用されるかが明確ではありません。
	すなわち、民法をはじめとする実体法の条文は、特定の事実があったときは特定の法律効果が生じるというような規定のしかたをしています。
	しかし、裁判において誰がどのような事実を立証すれば特定の法律効果の発生を主張でき、あるいはどのような事実を立証すれば法律効果が発生しないことを主張できるかまでを規定しているわけではないのです。
	このことは、裁判の結果を直接左右します。
	なぜなら、ある者がある事実を立証すべき場合（これを「立証責任」といいます。）に、その事実の立証ができなければ、その事実は裁判上存在しないものとして取り扱われるからです。

	このまま、アベノミクスが実現できなければ、日銀総裁のクビも危ういのです。
	なりふり構っていられないという要因でマイナス金利拡大を進めてしまう可能性があるのです。
	日銀の金利ターゲットの住宅ローン金利への影響
	前述したように日銀は
	マイナス金利を推しすすめるためには銀行からの圧力が大きい→マイナス金利が国債金利にも波及し、銀行や保険会社の経営状況が悪化した
	国債買い入れは辞められない→辞めたら投資家に見限られて円高株安になってしまい、アベノミクスが失敗に終わる
	という板挟みの状況に陥っていました。
	そこで９月２０日の金融政策決定会合で「金利ターゲット」という金融政策の導入を決めたのです。

	２事実の証明についての二側面
	１で述べたように要件事実論においては、実体法について事実の証明という観点から改めて考えることとなります。
	民法においては、事実の証明について二通りの規定のしかたをしているものがあります。
	例えば、民法７０９条（不法行為責任）の場合のように条文どおりの形で事実の証明を考えればよいものと、民法４１５条（債務不履行責任）の場合のように条文とは反対の形で証明の対象となる事実を考えるものです。
	すなわち、民法４１５条では、債務者の責任に帰すべき事由があって履行できない場合には損害賠償責任を負う旨規定されていますが、事実の証明を念頭に置いてこの条文を考えると、「履行ができなかったときは、債務者は損害賠償責任がある。ただし、それが債務者の責任に帰すことができない事由に基づく場合はこの限りでない」というように考え、但書きの事由があったことが証明されない限り損害賠償責任があるとみることができるわけです。
	したがって、実体法については民法７０９条のように条文どおりに証明を考えるものと、民法４１５条のように条文とは反対の形から証明の対象となる事実を考えるものの二類型があることになります。
	どのような場合にどちらの類型を適用すべきかについて基準が必要なわけで、これが要件事実論です。
	要件事実論を踏まえた実体法は、事実の証明についての要件を踏まえたものですから、「裁判規範としての法律」となり得ます。
	すなわち、事実関係を考察したとき、どのような事実が法律的解決に関係あるのかないのか、これらの事実をどちらが立証すべきについての判断を与えてくれることになります。
