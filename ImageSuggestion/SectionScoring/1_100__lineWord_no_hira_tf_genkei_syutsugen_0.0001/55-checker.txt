	銀閣寺を建て始めた時期
	応仁の乱が終わって間もない時、銀閣寺の建設は始まります。
	ちなみに、応仁の乱は応仁元年（１４６７年）〜文明９年（１４７７年）です。
	建設が始まったのは文明１４年（１４８２年）の事です。
	銀閣寺が建った歴史背景
	１０年も続いた応仁の乱で人々はかなり疲弊、土地はボロボロの状態でしたが、
	その５年後から銀閣寺の建設が始まりました。
	当時は今よりも技術が無かった為、まだまだ土地は回復せず、
	人々も心が晴れるにはすごく時間がかかっていたでしょう。
	建設はそれから８年も続けられ、足利義政が亡くなる直前にやっと終わったそうです。

	なぜ銀閣寺を建てたのか
	足利義政は文明５年には息子に将軍の地位を譲っていたのです。
	その９年後、銀閣寺の建設が始まります。
	実は先代の真似事だった
	３代将軍足利義満が金閣寺を建てていますが、
	この銀閣寺はそれを真似て作ったと言われています。
	もともと、義満も隠居の為に金閣寺を保有していたそうですが、
	この銀閣寺も隠居の為に作られたのです。
	完成を待てずに住んでしまう子供っぷり
	すみません、子供っぷりは私個人のイメージです。
	銀閣寺の建設を始めたのは、文明１４年（１４８２年）ですが、
	その翌年、文明１５年にはもう銀閣寺に住んでいたという記録があるそうです。
	完成には８年の歳月が費やされたとなっているのに、
	着工から１年後には住み始めてしまうという、
	かなりの前ノリだったのが分かります。
	それだけ隠居したかったのでしょう。
	住み始めてからは、お茶を楽しんだり、習字、筆で書く絵で余生を送っていたのだそうです。
	銀閣寺に関する小話
	ちょっとした小話をご紹介します。
	銀閣寺にはもう一つ名前があった
	タイトルの通りですとちょっと語弊がありますが、
	正式名称は実は銀閣寺ではなく「慈照寺（じしょうじ）」といいます。
	金閣寺にも名前がある通り、銀閣寺にもしっかりした名前がついています。
	金閣を真似して作ったから、銀閣。
	なんとも分かり易いネーミングでしょう。
	銀閣寺には面白い形の庭がある
	俗にいう日本庭園とはまた違った面白い庭が銀閣寺にはあります。
