	ヒトに強く訴えかける光の効果
	細かく明暗差が変えられるというのは、光の調整ができるということです。
	光というのは五感の長といわれる「目」で感じられる最初のものですし、「走光性」もあるように最も生物の本能に訴えかけるもののひとつです。
	光が微調整できる効果は映像１枚できれいだと思わせるだけではありません。
	前後の映像の違いに光の差を加えることで、心情の細かな表現までも可能にします。
	暗い部屋に明るい光が差し込むシーン
	例えば、最初に地下室の暗い中で一人で生活をしていた主人公が明るい光の中で自分以外の人と出会うシーンがあるのですが、明暗差をはっきりつけることで孤独さから温かさ、そしてまぶしさや戸惑いといった主人公が感じる世界の変化、その後の暗い宇宙に飛び出すシーンでは、明るい所から再び不安感を誘う闇の中に身を投じる感覚をより深く体感できました。

	もしかしたら、今後の映像制作において「光」というのは表現の新たなベクトルになるのかもしれません。
	今後舞台でいうところの照明係のような仕事が、アニメ制作の世界でも確立するのではないでしょうか。
	また、これまで技術上表現が不可能だったことで可能になることも多いでしょう。
	アニメは原作者の意図をますます反映したものになると思われます。
	これまであきらめていたであろうものが実現化することを考えると、わくわくしてきます。
	今回の視聴においても、原作を読んでいる身としては、単に映像がきれいになっただけではなく、より原作の世界観を出せたことで魅力を増した部分もあるなと感じました。
	とはいえ、最初は表現の豊かさに慣れず、「不気味の谷」のような抵抗を感じる人もいるかもしれません。
	でも、最初はどんなテクノロジーに関してもあるものでしょうし、触れていく中で、よりよいものが見つかったり、ユーザーに合わせて洗練されたりして、定着していくものでしょう。
	今後ＨＤＲを介して、どんな魅力的な作品が出てくるのか？それがＮｅｔｆｌｉｘのような配信サービスを通して、色々な国で楽しむことができる．．．。
	新たな時代が始まる予感を感じるとともに、これからが楽しみでなりません。

	これは別物．．．新鮮さをもって新たに楽しめる
	もともと『シドニアの騎士』という作品の舞台が、謎の生命体「奇居子（ガウナ）」によって太陽系が破壊された世界で、宇宙船によって移民できる星を求めて航海をしている、というもの。
	ずっと地下で暮らしていた主人公が、宇宙でガウナと戦う人型兵器の操縦士になる、というエピソードが今回視聴した第一話です。

	比較映像を見る前のパネルディスカッションにおいて『シドニアの騎士』の石丸健二プロデューサーが語っていたことですが、今までは選べる色域に限界があったため、これまで選択的に切り捨てられてた細かい部分が表現できるようになったそうです。
