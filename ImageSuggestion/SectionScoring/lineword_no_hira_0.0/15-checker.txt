	舞台と世界観ゆえに、モノトーンの色使いが多い作品です。
	よって、「黒と白を段階的に細かく表現できる」ＨＤＲの効果がいかんなく感じられる、ＨＤＲ化にふさわしい作品といえるでしょう。
	今回は左はＨＤＲ、右はＳＤＲで２台「４Ｋ有機ＥＬレグザ６５×９１０」のテレビが置かれており、その差を実感できるようになっていました。
	一目ぱっと見ただけでもＨＤＲの方はコントラストがしっかりとし、映像全体が濃く見えるだけではなく、深みが出て迫力が増したと感じました。
	繊細な光の表現が可能にした、深みと味わい。

	ヒトに強く訴えかける光の効果
	細かく明暗差が変えられるというのは、光の調整ができるということです。
	光というのは五感の長といわれる「目」で感じられる最初のものですし、「走光性」もあるように最も生物の本能に訴えかけるもののひとつです。
	光が微調整できる効果は映像１枚できれいだと思わせるだけではありません。
	前後の映像の違いに光の差を加えることで、心情の細かな表現までも可能にします。
	暗い部屋に明るい光が差し込むシーン
	例えば、最初に地下室の暗い中で一人で生活をしていた主人公が明るい光の中で自分以外の人と出会うシーンがあるのですが、明暗差をはっきりつけることで孤独さから温かさ、そしてまぶしさや戸惑いといった主人公が感じる世界の変化、その後の暗い宇宙に飛び出すシーンでは、明るい所から再び不安感を誘う闇の中に身を投じる感覚をより深く体感できました。

	もしかしたら、今後の映像制作において「光」というのは表現の新たなベクトルになるのかもしれません。
	今後舞台でいうところの照明係のような仕事が、アニメ制作の世界でも確立するのではないでしょうか。
	また、これまで技術上表現が不可能だったことで可能になることも多いでしょう。
	アニメは原作者の意図をますます反映したものになると思われます。
	これまであきらめていたであろうものが実現化することを考えると、わくわくしてきます。
	今回の視聴においても、原作を読んでいる身としては、単に映像がきれいになっただけではなく、より原作の世界観を出せたことで魅力を増した部分もあるなと感じました。
	とはいえ、最初は表現の豊かさに慣れず、「不気味の谷」のような抵抗を感じる人もいるかもしれません。
	でも、最初はどんなテクノロジーに関してもあるものでしょうし、触れていく中で、よりよいものが見つかったり、ユーザーに合わせて洗練されたりして、定着していくものでしょう。
	今後ＨＤＲを介して、どんな魅力的な作品が出てくるのか？それがＮｅｔｆｌｉｘのような配信サービスを通して、色々な国で楽しむことができる．．．。
	新たな時代が始まる予感を感じるとともに、これからが楽しみでなりません。

	ＨＤＲの映像の特徴は明暗のコントラストがはっきりとし、使える色域が広いので、奥行きや立体感のある描写ができます。
	そのため、臨場感のある映像になるとのこと。
	ＨＤＲの映像は対応するテレビで見られますが、有機ＥＬディスプレイ採用テレビはノイズが少ないので、より楽しむことができるそうです。
	そこで今回は、日本市場で国内メーカー初の４Ｋ有機ＥＬテレビである、東芝「４Ｋ有機ＥＬレグザ×９１０シリーズ」での上映会となりました。
	ＨＤＲならではの真価を感じられる、いわば究極のテレビというわけですね。

	光というのは、表現の上で非常に重要な要素です。
	伝統芸能の時代から、たとえば「能」では、演者のつける仮面はすべての感情をそぎ落とした無表情なものですが、光があたることで喜びや悲しみを変幻自在に表現してきました。
	現代でも舞台を作り上げる時やテレビの収録など、照明係というのは欠かせないポジションになっています。

	もともと『シドニアの騎士』という作品の舞台が、謎の生命体「奇居子（ガウナ）」によって太陽系が破壊された世界で、宇宙船によって移民できる星を求めて航海をしている、というもの。
	ずっと地下で暮らしていた主人公が、宇宙でガウナと戦う人型兵器の操縦士になる、というエピソードが今回視聴した第一話です。
