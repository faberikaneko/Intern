	語源とする説もいろいろとあるようですが、日本古来の音楽であります、「雅楽（ががく）」の中の一曲に、「千秋楽」という特別な曲があるそうです。
	こちらの楽曲が、必ず最後の曲として演奏されていた事にちなんで、最後日にかけて、「千秋楽」と呼び出したようです。
	また、呼び方を省略して「楽日（らくび）」と言ったり、最終日の先日のことを、「前楽（まえらく）」と言ったりもするそうです。
	「千秋」が略されているのですね。
	ちなみに「千穐楽」と記述する場合も多いようですが、これは「秋」の字に「火」が入っている為、その昔、火事の多かった繁華街では、火事を連想する「火」を意味嫌い「穐」と記述していたのだそうです。
	言葉一つにもいろいろなルーツがあって、調べてみると面白いものですね。

	それによるとロンドンスモッグの悪臭や空の色の異常、人体への影響を引き起こしたのは、硫酸塩とよばれる硫酸の粒子。
	研究チームは自然発生した霧の状況下、硫酸塩が水滴のなかで二酸化硫黄と二酸化窒素の化学相互作用によって形成されたことを証明しました。
	またこうした硫黄や窒素は、石炭を燃やした煙突や、僅かながら自動車から排出されたと考えられています。
	そして、硫酸塩は硝酸塩や有機物などの粒子が形成するのを促進し、霧の状態をさらに悪化させました。
	その後、霧に含まれる水分が乾くと、霧の中に含まれていた酸が濃縮され、有害物質を生み出し、それは人の肺など触れたものすべてを覆い尽くしたのです。
	同様の化学反応は、北京や西安の霧がかった空にも確認されました。
	これらの都市ではアンモニアのような農薬が原因だと考えられています。
	気候や化学的な条件はさまざまにあるものの、今回の研究でロンドンスモッグのような状況は、理論上、世界中で発生する可能性があると示されています。

	水引の結び方には一度結んだらほどけない「結びきり」と、ほどいて何度も結ぶことのできる結び方の「蝶結び」があります。
	［結びきり］は結婚や、お悔やみごとのように二度とくり返してはいけないことに使い、［蝶結び］は何度もくり返してよい一般的な祝い事に使います。
	のし袋は、奉書紙や半紙を用いて手作りの包みを作ることもできます。
	その場合慶事なら２枚、弔事なら１枚の紙を使いますが、慶事と弔事では折り方が逆になります。
	市販のものを使う場合でも、お金を入れた後に折り方を間違えることの無いようにしましょう。

	のしあわびの「のし」は“延ばす、延びる”に通じ、古来中国で鮑は不老長寿の薬効があるとされていたことから、寿命を延ばすおめでたいものの象徴とされ、祝儀、お祝い事の贈り物などに添えて用いられました。
	のちに、熨斗鮑の代わりに、昆布や紙を使うようになりました。
	現代では、のし袋やのし紙などに右イラストのように用いられています。

	別れる、離れる、ほどける．．．という意味から、簡単にほどいたり結んだりすることができる「蝶結び」ののしは結婚のお祝いにはふさわしくないと考えられています。

	統計・分析における開発現場の実態
	独立行政法人情報処理推進機構（ＩＰＡ）の統計（出典：『ソフトウェア開発データ白書２００８』）によると、実に９５％以上のプロジェクトがウォーターフォール型のライフサイクルで開発されています。
	恐らく、ウォーターフォール型のプロセスの方が誰にでも理解しやすいこと、改修案件の場合など前回のプロセスがウォーターフォール型であったため、今回も同じプロセスを採用するという心理が働いたりすることが原因ではないかと考えられます。
	次に、ユーザーの要求仕様に関して、３５％以上のプロジェクトは「あいまい」であり、３０％以上のプロジェクトで「ユーザー担当者の要求仕様への関与が不十分」という統計もあります。
	その結果、ＱＣＤをすべて達成したと評価するプロジェクトは全体の２／３程度で、残りは品質、コスト、工期のいずれかの項目が計画通りに達成できなかったというデータもあります。
	このように、３つに１つのプロジェクトは、ウォーターフォールの当初の計画通りに進んでないということになります。
	つまり、プロジェクトの初期段階で完全な計画を立てるのは非常に難しいことが分かります。

	開発手法は単純にウォーターフォールが悪い、アジャイルは良い、というものではなく、重要なのはプロジェクトを失敗させないことにあります。
	どのような開発手法においても、プロジェクトには必ずリスクが存在します。
	プロジェクト失敗の原因の多くは以下のようなものです。
	・スケジュールの欠陥―強気過ぎるスケジュールは悪。
	予実の乖離（かいり）を生み出す。
	・要求の増大（変更）―外的要因も影響し、時間の経過と共に要求は変わっていく。
	・人員の離脱―見積もりの時点で、メンバー離職の可能性は大抵考慮されていない。
	・仕様の崩壊―仕様はあいまいに作れるが、製品はあいまいに作れない。
	・生産性の低迷―少人数チームでは平均値のブレが大きい。
	能力がマイナスに振れるリスク
	これらのリスクが担保できるのであれば、開発プロセスがアジャイルでもウォーターフォールであっても構いません。
	それぞれのメリット・デメリットを検討した上、よりプロジェクトが成功しやすい開発プロセスを選択すべきです。

	各フェーズは１つ以上の反復で構成されます。
	このように、短いスパンで成果物をリリースし、その都度評価を行うことにより、リスクを最小化しようとしたのがＲＵＰのアジャイルプロセスです。

	製造コスト面では不利なＦＲ
	運転の楽しさを実現するという点で有利なＦＲですが、逆に製造コストは高くなり、エンジンの生む駆動力を後輪に伝えるために必要になるドライブシャフトが車体中央の床下を貫通するため室内空間が狭くなるといったデメリットもあります。
	このようなことから少しでも製造コストを下げ、より広い室内空間を確保するという最近のクルマ作りには合わず、多少の走りを犠牲にしてもフロント・エンジン＋前輪駆動という「ＦＦ」が国内外の多くのモデルで採用されています。

	ヒトに強く訴えかける光の効果
	細かく明暗差が変えられるというのは、光の調整ができるということです。
	光というのは五感の長といわれる「目」で感じられる最初のものですし、「走光性」もあるように最も生物の本能に訴えかけるもののひとつです。
	光が微調整できる効果は映像１枚できれいだと思わせるだけではありません。
	前後の映像の違いに光の差を加えることで、心情の細かな表現までも可能にします。
	暗い部屋に明るい光が差し込むシーン
	例えば、最初に地下室の暗い中で一人で生活をしていた主人公が明るい光の中で自分以外の人と出会うシーンがあるのですが、明暗差をはっきりつけることで孤独さから温かさ、そしてまぶしさや戸惑いといった主人公が感じる世界の変化、その後の暗い宇宙に飛び出すシーンでは、明るい所から再び不安感を誘う闇の中に身を投じる感覚をより深く体感できました。

	物語が始まる第一話は、人類という種の落日を象徴するかのように、建物の外の明るい場面でも夕焼けのような光です。
	暗い部屋に差し込む光も同じで、逆光があたるシーンが多くなっており、微妙な明暗ができます。
	それによって繊細な表情の変化が見られます。
	また、光のあたった人物の影の中にあるものや、建物の背景の景色など、かつては描き込まれていなかったものが描かれ、本来このようなものが周りにあったのかという新鮮な驚きがありました。

	ＨＤＲの映像の特徴は明暗のコントラストがはっきりとし、使える色域が広いので、奥行きや立体感のある描写ができます。
	そのため、臨場感のある映像になるとのこと。
	ＨＤＲの映像は対応するテレビで見られますが、有機ＥＬディスプレイ採用テレビはノイズが少ないので、より楽しむことができるそうです。
	そこで今回は、日本市場で国内メーカー初の４Ｋ有機ＥＬテレビである、東芝「４Ｋ有機ＥＬレグザ×９１０シリーズ」での上映会となりました。
	ＨＤＲならではの真価を感じられる、いわば究極のテレビというわけですね。

	主なショートパスタの種類をご紹介します！
	マカロニ（太・細）
	円筒状（穴あき）の直径２～５ｍｍ、円周部の肉厚１ｍｍ前後のショートパスタ。
	日本ではもっともポピュラーなショートパスタです。
	日本ではサラダやグラタンに調理する場合が多く、濃いめのソースとよく合います。
	ペンネ
	円筒状のショートパスタの両端をペン先のように斜めにカットしたショートパスタ。
	両端が斜めにカットされていることにより、ソースが筒の中に入り安く味がしみこみやすいのが特徴です。
	ツイスト
	縄状によられた形状。
	日本国内ではサラダに調理されることが多いが、海外では、ソースとともに、または野菜、魚介類、オリーブオイルで調理して食べることが多いパスタです。
	カール
	紡錘状で、ひれが螺旋状によじれた形状のショートパスタ。
	ドレッシングやマヨネーズが絡まりやすい形状のため、サラダによく合います。
	シェル
	貝の形をしたショートパスタ。
	表面に筋が入り、幅１０～２０ｍｍのものが一般的です。
	大型のものは詰め物をして調理することもできます。

	ＦＦと違ってＦＲではエンジンの動力をシャフトを使って後輪に伝える必要があります。
	ＦＦよりも大がかりなので、比較的故障する確率は高いと言えます。
	ＦＦではエンジンが横置きなので、クルマの室内が広く取れるというメリットがありました。
	逆にＦＲではエンジンが縦置きなので、室内を広くするためには、結局、クルマ自体を大きくするしかありません。
	するとエンジンの回転方向をタイヤに対して９０度の向きで置く必要が出てきます。
	これをシャフトでクルマの後部に伝え、そこでギアを使って再び向きを９０度変えて後輪を回すわけです。

	ＢＭＷのクルマは全て、車体前部に縦に置かれたエンジンから生み出されるパワーをリア・ホイールへと伝達させます。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズも例外ではありません。
	後輪駆動方式は伝統的なＢＭＷの特徴であり、魅力的な走り、優れたトラクション、安心できるハンドリングを実現する大事な要素なのです。
	後輪駆動の有効性は、荷物を積むほど高まります。
	前輪を駆動するクルマでは、満載状態になると前車軸への荷重が減少して、トラクションに悪影響を及ぼします。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズならば、このようなことは起こりません。

	なお、高級車＝ＦＲという話になりましたが、スポーツカーの世界でも後輪駆動が主流です。
	Ｆ１などのレーシングカーはＭＲですし、前回も書いたようにポルシェの代表車種はＲＲです。
	フェラーリもランボルギーニもＭＲです。
	エンジンの置き場所こそ違えど、駆動輪はみんな後輪です。
	レーシングにおいては自動車のバランスは非常に重要です。
	ＦＦ車はどうしてもクルマの前部が重くなりますが、後輪駆動車は前後のバランスが均等に近くなります。
	また後輪駆動のほうがアンダーステアが発生しにくい（オーバーステアが発生しやすい）ので、コーナーを曲がることが重視されるレースの世界では重宝されます。

	まず、おさらいですが、ＦＲというのは前（Ｆｒｏｎｔ）にエンジンがあって、後ろ（Ｒｅａｒ）のタイヤが回るということでしたよね。
	上のイラストの左半分を見てもらえばわかるように、ＦＦと違って、ＦＲではエンジンは縦置きです。
	そのエンジンから、長いパイプ（これをドライブシャフトと言います）が伸びていて、後ろのタイヤに動力を伝えて、後ろのタイヤが回るようになっています。
	クラウンやベンツのような高級車やタクシーに乗ったときに、後部座席の足元の真ん中が盛り上がっていますよね。
	あれがシャフトの通り道です。
	当然ながら、ＦＦ車では後部座席の足元は平らです。
	ＦＲでは、ＦＦのデメリットが逆にメリットであることが多いです。
	まず、ＦＦでは駆動輪＝操舵輪ですので、ハンドルにエンジンの振動が伝わりやすいと書きました。
	ＦＲではエンジンは後輪につながっていて、前輪は操舵だけしかしません。
	なので、当然エンジンの不快な振動はハンドルには伝わりにくいです。
	また、駆動輪を操舵しませんので、ハンドルの操作感覚も自然です。
	また、エンジンが縦置きなので、エンジンとタイヤの隙間が大きく、サスペンションもしっかりした物が取り付けられます。
	よって、地面からの震動もしっかり吸収できます。
	あと、イラストの右側部分を見てください。
	ＦＦと違ってＦＲでは後輪に遠心力がかかります。
	つまり、クルマの後部が外側（右へのカーブの時は左）に向かおうとするので、クルマは曲がりやすくなります。
	これをオーバーステアといいます。
	ＦＦの曲がりにくい性質をアンダーステアと言いましたよね。
	振動が少なくてハンドルも自然で曲がりやすい。

	後輪駆動の問題点はスペース効率が悪い、重量配分がせいぜい５０：５０にしかならないところです。
	後輪駆動なのですから、本来はもっと後輪に対して重量配分したいところなのですがそれが出来ない。
	それは重いエンジンとトランスミッションが前にあるからです。
	トランスアクスルでリアヘビーにするなどの努力もありますが、スペース効率が犠牲になります。
	これが成立するのはスポーツカーだけでしょう。
	ミッドシップにすれば後輪に荷重をかけられますが、さらにスペースを圧迫してしまいますのでやはりスポーツカーでしか成立しません。
	人や荷物を効率よく載せたいのなら前輪駆動が良いです。
	世界初の前輪駆動を採用したＭＩＮＩはあのサイズで４人乗れ、しかもラリーで後輪駆動のポルシェをぶっちぎって３年連続優勝した経歴もあります。

	ヒトに感染するインフルエンザウイルスには、Ａ型・Ｂ型・Ｃ型の３つがあり、現在流行の中心となっているのはＡ型とＢ型です。
	Ａ型は症状が重篤になる傾向があり、死に至ることもあります。
	また感染力が強いため、大流行（パンデミック）を起こしやすく、過去には香港かぜやスペインかぜなどの世界的な流行で多くの死者を出しました。
	２００９年に世界中で流行したいわゆる「新型インフルエンザ」は、Ａ型、Ｈ１Ｎ１亜型というものでした。
	Ｂ型は、Ａ型よりも症状が比較的軽く、限られた地域で流行するケースが見られます。
	Ｃ型は鼻かぜ程度の軽い症状ですむことが多いウイルスです。

	インフルエンザの治療
	【一般療法】
	できるだけ安静にし、栄養と十分な睡眠を取ります。
	インフルエンザウイルスの空気中での活動や感染を抑えるために、加湿器などで室内の湿度を５０～６０％に保ちます。
	水分を十分に補います。
	お茶、スープ、ジュースなど何でもいいので飲みたいものを飲みます。
	【対症療法】
	発熱や関節痛などに対しては解熱鎮痛薬、鼻水やくしゃみに抗ヒスタミン薬などが用いられます。
	一方、インフルエンザの症状はインフルエンザウイルスに対して免疫が正常に働いている結果であり、薬で無理に抑えないほうがよいという考え方もあります。
	市販の薬を自己判断で使用することは、かえって逆効果になる場合があるので、医師の指示にしたがってください。

	【抗ウイルス療法】
	インフルエンザウイルスに対する治療薬として、塩酸アマンタジンとノイラミニダーゼ阻害薬があります。
	塩酸アマンタジンはＡ型インフルエンザウイルスに有効で耐性が起こりやすいのですが、ノイラミニダーゼ阻害薬はＡ型、Ｂ型どちらのインフルエンザウイルスにも有効です。
	但し、これらの抗ウイルス薬は発病後４８時間以内に服用しないと効果がありません。
	また、現在日本ではノイラミニダーゼ阻害薬のリン酸オセルタミビルと塩酸アマンタジンを予防薬として使用することができますが、１３歳以上に限るという制限など、いくつかの条件があるので医療機関に相談してください。

	インフルエンザの予防
	インフルエンザの予防に効果が期待できるのがワクチンの接種です。
	流行シーズンを迎える前の１１月ごろの接種をおすすめします。
	インフルエンザワクチンは、１３歳未満は原則として、２～４週間の間隔をおいて２回接種します。
	１３歳～６４歳は１回または２回かは医師と相談して決めてください。
	６５歳以上の高齢者や過去にインフルエンザにかかったことがある人なら、１回の予防接種でも十分な免疫力が得られるといわれています。
	効果が現われるのはおよそ２週間後からで、その後約５カ月間持続するといわれています。

	写真のコンクリート軌条の側面に、細長い金属のレール（下側）が付いているのが、架線に当たる第三軌条なんです。
	実は、写真の反対側にも同じものがあります。
	これは、電気のプラスとマイナスがそれぞれ付いているのです。
	一般の電車では、架線からプラスの電気を取り入れると、マイナスの電気は線路に流しています。
	しかし、コンクリートのレールの上を走るモノレールでは、マイナス電気を流す電気のためのレールが別に必要になるのです。

	走行にはゴムタイヤが使用され、Ｉ型のレールを両側から挟みこむようにゴムタイヤは配置されています。
	また、単に両側から挟みこむだけでは安定しないので、上下２段、２対のゴムタイヤが配置され、走行の安定性を保証しています。
	このようにして、１本だけの不安定なレールの上を、安定して走ることが出来るのです。
	この車輪が存在することで、走行方向などが案内されるために、案内輪と言われています。

	リーマン・ブラザースは、南北戦争の最中、北軍の兵士が着用する軍服を製造するための綿花の調達に東奔西走した。
	南部が綿花の大産地であったため、南部を敵にした戦争では綿花の調達が困難になった。
	リーマン・ブラザースは、南部に潜入し、南部の軍人・農民を「金で買収し」、綿花を買い付け、さらに不足する物資を、ヨーロッパに出向き、買い付け、ヨーロッパの商社からインド産の綿花、また、火薬・銃器を買い付け、北軍に提供した。
	南軍＝敵軍に潜入し、敵軍を買収し、物資を調達する、スパイ活動・諜報工作を専門とする、軍事商社が、リーマン・ブラザースであった。
	そして、アメリカの内乱＝南北の対立・戦争に乗じ、「金儲け」しようとするヨーロッパの武器商人＝戦争商人の先兵が、軍事商社リーマン・ブラザースであった。
	同時に、南部の軍人を買収し資金を提供し、南軍の兵器調達の費用をリーマン・ブラザースが提供し、南軍にヨーロッパ製の兵器を売りつけ、その利益で南部の綿花を買い付け、その綿花を北軍に売り、さらに同時に、北軍「にも」ヨーロッパ製の兵器を売りつける。
	南北軍の戦争を、アオリ、両者に兵器を売りつける、戦争商人が、リーマン・ブラザースであった。

	この投資家の方は、シャープの株価が下がると予想していたため、証券会社からシャープの株を借りてきて、その株を売りました。
	シャープの株価が下がったら、その時点でシャープの株を買い戻して、証券会社にシャープの株を返済するつもりでした。
	ところが、この投資家の意に反してシャープの株価は上昇してしまいました。
	この投資家の方は高い株価でシャープの株を買い戻して証券会社にシャープ株を返済する羽目になったのです。
	信用取引の場合は自己資金の約３倍の売買が可能になるため、利益も損失も大きくなりがちなのです。
	初心者の方は信用取引には決して手を出さず、最低３年程度は現物取引（通常の株式投資）で経験を積んでください。
	３まとめ
	株で大損しないために最低限すべきことをお分かりいただけたでしょうか。
	自分を守る最低限の知識は身に着ける、注文するときは細心の注意を払う、そして損切りルールを定めて冷徹にそれを実行する。
	とても地味ですが、この３つが株で大損しないための鉄則です。
	まずは、大損しないことを強く意識して投資経験を積み、勝率を上げていきましょう。

	この時、コンピューターの画面には注文内容の異常を警告する表示が出ていましたが、担当者はこれを無視して注文を執行しました。
	当時の報道によると、「警告はたまに表示されるため、つい無視してしまった」とのことです。
	この注文によってジェイコムの株価は急落し、みずほ証券のみならず、東京証券取引所をも巻き込んだ大問題に発展しました。
	巨額の損失が出たことは言うまでもありません。

	残りの約４００万円は証券会社から借りることになります。
	また、今現在、手元に株式を保有していなくても、証券会社からその株式を借りることで、「売り」から始めることもできます。

	景気が回復する見通しは立っていない
	政策金利も０．１％のゼロ金利政策のまま
	日銀がマイナス金利を維持・拡大する可能性が高い
	日銀は金利ターゲットを導入した
	英国のＥＵ離脱の波及でさらに円高／株安、国債金利低下がすすむ可能性がある
	トランプ大統領就任によるドル高／円安／株高による住宅ローン金利上昇の影響は限定された範囲
	という理由から
	２０１７年は
	変動金利はそのままの低金利状態が維持される
	固定金利は金利ターゲットの影響で、１０年以上の固定金利はやや上昇。
	２年、３年、５年という短期金利はさらに低金利になる

	日銀の思惑は
	「日銀に預けているお金が企業への融資に回れば、企業の設備投資が増えて景気が良くなる。」
	「日銀に預けているお金が市場に出回れば、インフレになり、物価目標２．０％が達成できる。」
	というものです。
	そのためにマイナス金利を設定して、銀行が日銀に預けにくい環境にしたのです。

	国債金利は
	国債の買い手が増える→国債金利が下がる
	国債の売り手が増える→国債金利が上がる
	という関係にあります。
	買う人が増えると、金利が小さくても売れるため、国債の金利が下がるのです。
	逆に売り手が多くて、買い手が少ない状況だと、金利を高く設定しないと売れないため、国債金利が上がるのです。

	結果として、２０１６年は年末にかけて
	ドル高／円安→株高→国債金利上昇→住宅ローン金利上昇
	という動きが出ています。
	とはいえ、このまま住宅ローン金利が上昇するかというとそうではありません。
	トランプ大統領就任による期待値込みのご祝儀相場でドル高になっているだけ
	国債金利上昇で企業への融資が冷え込むのは日本政府はなんとしても避けたいので国債買入れを増強して金利を下げさせる
	金利ターゲットがあるので、国債金利も０．０％ぐらいに着地させるはず
	たしかに株価は上がっていますが、日本の景気とは関係のないところで上がっただけですから、住宅ローン金利が上昇する根本的な要因にはなっていません。

	・景気は良くなるのか？
	日本の景気が良くなれば、政策金利が上昇することになり、変動金利が高くなります。
	しかし、２０１７年という時点での景気回復は見通しが立っていないのが現状です。
	アベノミクスでの株価上昇というのは経済が良くなったのではなく、為替介入による円安誘導で株価が上がったに過ぎません。
	円安になると輸出企業の多い日本では、株高になるからです。
	日本円というのは不思議な立ち位置で、世界の経済情勢が悪化すると、外国人投資家・機関投資家はすぐに「円買い」に動きます。
	世界的にはまだ「円」は安全な通貨と認識されているのです。
	世界のどこかで経済的な不安を感じさせる事件があれば、すぐに円高になり、株安に戻ってしまうのです。
	為替だけでつくられたまやかしの株高は長くは続かないのです。
	アベノミクスの流れに沿うように商品価格を上げた企業も、続々とデフレ基準の価格に戻しています。
	個人の収入が増えていないのですから「商品価格を上げても売れなくなっただけ」というのがここ２年ぐらいでばれてしまったのです。
	為替に頼らないで景気回復をするためには、構造改革が必要となり、時間を要するのです。
	２０１７年に景気が回復する見通しというのは立たないのです。

	２事実の証明についての二側面
	１で述べたように要件事実論においては、実体法について事実の証明という観点から改めて考えることとなります。
	民法においては、事実の証明について二通りの規定のしかたをしているものがあります。
	例えば、民法７０９条（不法行為責任）の場合のように条文どおりの形で事実の証明を考えればよいものと、民法４１５条（債務不履行責任）の場合のように条文とは反対の形で証明の対象となる事実を考えるものです。
	すなわち、民法４１５条では、債務者の責任に帰すべき事由があって履行できない場合には損害賠償責任を負う旨規定されていますが、事実の証明を念頭に置いてこの条文を考えると、「履行ができなかったときは、債務者は損害賠償責任がある。ただし、それが債務者の責任に帰すことができない事由に基づく場合はこの限りでない」というように考え、但書きの事由があったことが証明されない限り損害賠償責任があるとみることができるわけです。
	したがって、実体法については民法７０９条のように条文どおりに証明を考えるものと、民法４１５条のように条文とは反対の形から証明の対象となる事実を考えるものの二類型があることになります。
	どのような場合にどちらの類型を適用すべきかについて基準が必要なわけで、これが要件事実論です。
	要件事実論を踏まえた実体法は、事実の証明についての要件を踏まえたものですから、「裁判規範としての法律」となり得ます。
	すなわち、事実関係を考察したとき、どのような事実が法律的解決に関係あるのかないのか、これらの事実をどちらが立証すべきについての判断を与えてくれることになります。

	１要件事実論とは
	Ｑ．要件事実論とはどのようなものでしょうか。
	ポイント
	１．民法、商法、所得税法や法人税法のような実体法では、事実の存在が証明できない場合にどのように条文を適用するのか不明である。
	２．事実の証明についての基準を考えるのが「要件事実論」である。
	３．要件事実論により再構成した実体法が「裁判規範としての法律」となり、訴訟に当たっての重要な拠り所となる。
	Ａ．
	１問題の所在
	民事上の紛争が生じた場合、裁判官は、紛争当事者から出された主張に対して民法や商法などの実体法に照らして判断し、判決を下すことにより解決することになります。
	ここでいう実体法とは、紛争を解決するに際して人々の権利義務を判断するために照らしてみる法律のことを指します。
	すなわち、実体法とは裁判官が訴訟に当たって判断を下すための基準となるわけです。
	ところが、実体法の規定では、必ずしも裁判においてどのように適用されるかが明確ではありません。
	すなわち、民法をはじめとする実体法の条文は、特定の事実があったときは特定の法律効果が生じるというような規定のしかたをしています。
	しかし、裁判において誰がどのような事実を立証すれば特定の法律効果の発生を主張でき、あるいはどのような事実を立証すれば法律効果が発生しないことを主張できるかまでを規定しているわけではないのです。
	このことは、裁判の結果を直接左右します。
	なぜなら、ある者がある事実を立証すべき場合（これを「立証責任」といいます。）に、その事実の立証ができなければ、その事実は裁判上存在しないものとして取り扱われるからです。

	・硬毛化・多毛化
	産毛が濃く硬くなったり、生えていなかった場所から毛が生えることがあります。
	科学的原因はハッキリしていませんが、熱量が関係していると言われています。
	同じ熱量でも太い毛は熱を集めることができるので毛の抑制が上手くいきます。
	一方、産毛などに同じ熱量を照射した場合、メラニン色素が少ないため、熱を毛に上手く届けることができず、結果弱い熱量が毛に届きます。
	これが、成長を活性化させているという説が有力です。

	・お金がかかる
	脱毛サロンで脱毛を完了させるためには平均２〜３年の継続が必須です。
	部位脱毛のような回数プランの場合は料金がわかりやすいですが、全身脱毛の場合は、月々の料金を抑えられる月額制プランが人気で総費用がわかりにくくなっています。
	月額プランは１回の脱毛が全身１回ではなく、全身を１／２〜１／６に分けて脱毛施術をしていきます。
	１回の脱毛範囲が狭いほど、脱毛完了までの期間が長くなり、料金も高くなります。
	毎月が安くても、２年も３年も払い続けるとなると、思っていた以上の金額が発生します。
	月額料金の平均金額は１００００円なので、通常２４００００円ほどの支払いが必要になります。
	対策
	月額料金が安いサロン＋全身を１／２づつ進められるサロンを選択する
	月額１００００円で１／６づつ進む→全身１回６００００円→１年間で全身２回→１２回達成するのに６年→７２００００円
	月額１００００円で１／２づつ進む→全身１回２００００円→１年間で全身６回→１２回達成するのに２年→２４００００円
	毎月が安くても、２年も３年も払い続けるとなると、思っていた以上の金額が発生するんですよ。
	契約するときには月額費用だけでなく、総費用も確認しておくことをオススメします。

	・毛が生えてこなくなる

	そうすると、元に戻すことができなくなるのでデメリットにもなる場合があります。
	・毛が生えてこなくなる
	毛をなくすことを目的に通ってはいますが、脱毛が完了すると半永久的に毛が生えてこなくなります。
	そうすると、元に戻すことができなくなるのでデメリットにもなる場合があります。
	例えばＶＩＯのお手入れの場合だと、一度ハイジニーナ（パイパン）のスタイルで脱毛が完了するとずっとそのままということです。
	対策方法
	・刺激や紫外線を感じやすくなる
	毛には体を保護する働きがあります。
	この毛がなくなることで今まで感じていなかった刺激や紫外線を直に感じやすくなります。
	対策
	体を洗う時や洋服の摩擦に気をつけることと、紫外線のケアを今まで以上に行う必要があります。
	脱毛直後はメラニンに刺激が加わっているため特に紫外線対策を強化することをオススメします！
	・脱毛前後は日焼けができない
	脱毛サロンに通う方の中で肌を焼きたいと思う方もいらっしゃると思いますが、脱毛前後の日焼けはＮＧです。
	脱毛後は肌が敏感になっているため、紫外線を浴びることで肌荒れを起こす場合がある為です。
	また、脱毛は１度の施術では終わりません。
	脱毛後にガン黒に焼いてしまうと、次の脱毛施術が受けられない場合があります

	・毛嚢炎のリスク
	カミソリなどの自己処理に比べると毛嚢炎ができる確率は低いですが、ゼロではありません。
	毛穴が少し傷ついただけで毛嚢炎はできることがあります。
	光脱毛では、熱を利用してムダ毛にダメージを与える仕組みなので、毛根周辺の毛包や表皮にも多少の熱ダメージが残ります。
	脱毛施術後の肌は一時的にバリア機能が下がりやすいので、ブドウ球菌がダメージを受けた毛包に入り込んできて、毛嚢炎を引き起こしてしまうことがあります。

	日焼けした肌が脱毛できない理由
	脱毛機はメラニン（黒いもの）に反応する仕組み→肌が日焼けで黒くなる→毛の黒に反応しにくくなる
	日焼けで肌が乾燥する→痛みを感じやすくなる
	日焼けで肌が黒くなる→メラニンに必要以上に反応して痛みを感じやすくなる
	対策
	小麦肌が好きな方は、夏は特に焼きたいと思うので、夏までに脱毛が完了するよに計算して脱毛を開始しましょう。
	脱毛期間中は日焼けを控えて、脱毛完了後肌が落ち着いてから焼くのがオススメです。
	オススメのコース
	ラヴォーグのスピードパックだと最短半年で全身の脱毛が完了回数の１２回通えます。

	・肌が乾燥しやすくなる
	光脱毛は施術時に光の熱エネルギーを使用するため、熱が水分を奪い肌が乾燥しやすくなります。
	また、毛の原料はタンパク質で、タンパク質を凝固させることで毛の成長を抑制していきます。
	この、タンパク質が固まる際に多くの水分を必要とするため一時的に肌が乾燥してしまいます。

	上記の表で着目していただきたいのは脱毛完了までの総費用です。
	一見お得に見える自己処理ですが、２００円のカミソリで自己処理をし続けると、１２９６０００円もかかるのは驚きですよね。
	費用・手間・時間もかかる自宅での自己処理は効率が悪いうえに、肌荒れのリスクは１番高いためオススメできません。
	カミソリでのお手入れって安く済ませたいからしてることなのに、総費用がこんなにかかるなんて驚き・・・それならサロン脱毛で安全に脱毛したほうがいいね・・・
	光脱毛ｖｓ医療脱毛
	大きな違いは使用する機械の出力と毛根を破壊できるかにあります。
	毛根を破壊していいかは法律で決まっているので、サロンでの脱毛で毛根を破壊することは禁止されています。
	光脱毛
	出力が弱く毛根は破壊してはいけない
	医療脱毛
	出力が高く毛根を破壊できる
	毛根を破壊できたほうが脱毛完了までの期間がグッと縮まります。
	これだけ聞くと、医療脱毛の方がいいの？となりがちですが、医療脱毛にもデメリットがあります。

	トマト界の最高級品種のため、モノによっては１箱（２４個）＝２５０００円！大阪の貧乏育ちの僕にとっては一切縁がなさそうなんですけど、この徳谷トマトを唯一生産しているのが前述の一宮徳谷地域なんだとか。

	コーディング規約のメリット・デメリット
	コーディング規約のメリットはプログラマの個性を殺して均質なプログラムを作ること、過去の知識や経験から得られたバグの発生源となりやすいコーディングの防止、インデントやコメントの基準を決めて見やすさ保守性の高さを求める・・・等々です。
	一方、デメリットですが、使える文法を制限してスキルの高いプログラマの生産性を殺したり、過去のプログラムとの互換性を追求するあまり新しい機能の使用を制限したり・・・等々があります。
	一般に、大きなプロジェクトほどコーディング規約の内容は強制的、制限的です。
	これは、大きなプロジェクトだと、スキルの低い人もメンバーに入っていることが多く、コーディングを自由にやらせると、品質が落ちたり、プログラムが見づらく保守性が悪くなるったりするためです。

	コーディング規約の内容
	コーディング規約の内容は、プロジェクトの規模や特性、参加メンバーのスキル、使用言語などにより変更すべきですが、たいていこんな内容が書かれています。
	目的
	プロジェクトの構成
	命名規則
	コーディングスタイル
	禁止事項
	制限事項
	推奨事項
	目的
	そのコーディング規約の適用範囲、なぜ必要なのか、それを守ることによりどんなメリットがあるかを書く。
	プロジェクトの構成
	コーディングにはあまり関係なさそうな内容ですが、ソースプログラムの先頭にコメントを入れたりするのに使います。
	プロジェクトの名称などはあらかじめ決まっていることが多いので、もし、そうなら一覧表を付けます。
	メタ情報の指定方法、フォルダの構成方法なども決めておきます。
	命名規則
	変数、定数、メソッド（関数）、クラスなどの名前の付け方の基準を決める。
	変数名の先頭は小文字だとか、クラス名の先頭は大文字だとかがよく使われます。
	コーディングスタイル
	コーディングスタイルはインデントの仕方とか、中かっこの位置とか、コメントの位置や内容とかを決めておきます。
	リソース
	エラーメッセージなどはハードコーディングしないで、よくリソースファイルのインデックスを指定したりします。
	もし使うなら、リソースの使用についての説明、制限なども書いておきましょう。
	（あまり大きいリソースの管理はたいへんなのでバランスを考えたほうがいいです。特にＩＤＥを使う場合。）
	禁止事項
	使ってはいけない文法や今はほとんど使われない保守用になっているものとかを揚げておきます。
	一律に禁止でなく、場合によっては例外も設けておきます。
	（なぜ禁止なのか、その理由も必ず書きます）
	制限事項
	あまり推奨されない機能、コーディング方法、クラスなどを揚げておきます。
	また、その条件を明示します。
	推奨事項
	好ましいコーディング方法や複数の似たようなクラスや関数などがある場合、どちらが推奨されるかを書いておきます。

	准看護師は看護師と比較して収入は低めです。
	しかし業務は看護師と同じ事を行っています。
	そこで個人経営をしている診療所やクリニックは人件費が抑えられる准看護師を比較的雇用します。

	看護師と准看護師の違いはあるが・・・
	このように、看護師と准看護師とでは、その資格の発行元が異なります。
	看護師は国が発行する資格であり、准看護師は都道府県の発行する資格なのです。
	准看護師は、「看護師の指示に従って」業務を行うことになります。
	つまり准看護師は、厳密には看護師の補助業務を行います。

	目の前に菓子鉢に入った菓子が運ばれて来る。
	もてなす側（ホスト）を亭主と呼び、客は「お菓子をどうぞ」と勧められてから手を伸ばす。
	先生が女性に「お隣に『お先に』と言ってください」と助言した。
	「お先にちょうだいしますの意味で、同席者への心配り」と、裏千家淡交会東京第一東支部幹事長の吉田宗雅さんは解説する。
	抹茶の入った茶わんでも同様にする。
	菓子の器を両手で持って少し持ち上げ、軽く頭を下げ神仏に感謝する。
	懐紙（かいし）の輪を自分に向けて菓子鉢の間に置き、箸で１つ取る。
	懐紙は皿やティッシュペーパーのように使う。
	箸は菓子を置いた懐紙の端でぬぐってから、鉢の上に元あったように戻す。
	器を隣に送った後、菓子は懐紙ごと口元近くに運び、添えられたようじで切り、軽く刺す。
	抹茶を飲む前に菓子を食べきるのが作法だ。
	懐紙とようじは持ち帰る。
	食べ終わるのを見計らい、お茶が運ばれる。
	菓子と同様に隣人に「お先に」と言い、亭主には「お点前（てまえ）頂戴いたします」と言って頭を下げて、軽く茶わんを上げ神仏に感謝を示す。
	茶わんは左手にのせて軽く右手を添える。
	飲むときに特に気をつけたいのは「お茶わんの正面から飲まないこと」と話すのは、池袋コミュニティ・カレッジ（東京都豊島区）で教える表千家教授の八代宗晴さん。
	茶わんは出されたときに自分の方に向いているのが正面。
	絵柄があることも多い。
	亭主は正面を客に向けるが、客は茶わんを大切にするため正面を避けて飲む。
	「化粧などの油分が正面につき、汚れないように」との配慮だ。
	流派によって多少異なるが、２度に分けて茶わんを回す。
	飲むのは３口半が理想だが、前後してもいい。
	飲み終わったら右手親指と人さし指で軽く飲み口を拭き、手は懐紙でぬぐう。
	茶わんは先ほどと反対に回して、正面を亭主側に戻して置く。

	＜刑務所の種類と分類基準＞
	刑務所には種類があり、それぞれに分類基準があります。
	主な分類基準は「性別」、「刑期」、「初犯・累犯」、「年齢」の４つ。
	（１）「性別」
	．．．特に詳しい説明はいらないと思います。
	「男」か「女」かそれだけです。
	男女が同じ刑務所で服役することはありません。
	（移送待ちの期間は同じ施設の別の建物で過ごすこともありますが）また、女子刑務所は施設自体が少なく、他の（２）～（３）までの分類基準が適応されていないようです。
	いわゆる「ごっちゃ混ぜ状態」という。
	（２）「刑期」
	．．．「１０年未満か１０年以上か」で分かれます。
	１０年以上であればと呼ばれる長期収容者の施設へ。
	（「Ｌ」とか呼ばれたりします）１０年未満であればそれ以外の施設へ。
	（３）「初犯・累犯」
	．．．ここ重要です。
	「２０歳以上になって初めて実刑判決を受けた人が初犯」です。
	なので未成年のときに鑑別所や少年院を経験していても「初犯」。
	以前に別の事件で執行猶予判決を受け、その猶予期間中に新しい事件を起こし服役することになっても「初犯」です。
	なので、「累犯」っていうのは「２０歳になってから２回以上刑務所にはいっている人」のこことです。
	ちなみにかなり素行が悪く「犯罪傾向が進んでいる」と判断された場合は「初犯」の人でも「累犯」の施設に移送になることがあります。
	あと、初犯刑務所は「Ａ級」、累犯刑務所は「Ｂ級」って呼ばれたりもします。
	（４）「年齢」
	．．．「２６歳未満か２６歳以上か」で分かれます。
	もし２６歳未満であれば「少年刑務所」といわれる施設に移送される可能性が出てきます。
	ただ、２６歳未満であっても一般の刑務所に移送される場合もあるので一概にはいえません。
	※補足
	（５）その他
	１、「社会復帰促進センター」
	．．．全国に４つだけ存在する「半分民間、半分国が経営」する施設。
	従来の施設より「民間主導による教育プログラム」に力を入れているのが主な特徴で、建物自体も新しいです。
	ちなみに初犯の人しか入れません。
	２、「交通刑務所」
	．．．「交通系の前科」が主に集まる刑務所。
	「ひき逃げ」とかですね。
	ただ、全員が全員行けるかと言われればそうじゃなく、他の施設に行く人も大勢います。

	安いお酒を避け、高いお酒を飲む
	お酒の値段は非常に重要な二日酔いの指標になります。
	理由は値段が高いほどより不純物を取り除く（メタノールを含む）作業が多く行われているからです。
	同じ蒸留酒であっても高いお酒を飲むほうが二日酔いしにくく体にも優しくなります。
	同じお酒でもメーカーなどによっても成分は異なる
	同じ値段のビールであってもＡ社だと二日酔いしないがＳ社だと二日酔いしやすい、とうい現象はよくあることです。

	不純物入りを避ける
	ある実験で赤ワインと白ワインを飲んだグループを比較した所、赤ワインを飲んだグループの方が血中セントロニン、ヒスタミンの濃度が高く、二日酔いによる頭痛の程度が激しかったという結果が出ました。
	これはアルコールに含まれる不純物の量による違いです。
	意外ですが、ウォッカはアルコール濃度の割りには二日酔いしにくくなっています。
	ウォッカはバーボンの１／３７の不純物しか含まれません。
	メタノール含有は避ける
	メタノール含有は避けるウィスキーやブランデーといった風味が強く独特のクセのある蒸留酒やワインなどの果実酒には、微量のメタノールが含まれています。
	これらメタノールは通常のアルコールと比較すると身体に長く留まります。
	理由はエタノールの分解がメタノールにより阻害されることと、メタノールは分解に非常に長い時間がかかるためです。
	その結果、翌朝以降もお酒が残ってしまい二日酔いの症状が長引く原因となります。
	また、メタノールそのものが有毒であり、少量であっても頭痛、めまい、吐き気の原因になります。
	同じビールであっても柑橘系のビールだと二日酔いしやすいなどはこのメタノールが原因かもしれません。
	メタノールが原因の二日酔いについてはメタノールが原因の二日酔い対策をご参照下さい。

	４．ミディアムロング
	ビジネスとしては取り入れにくいが、そのふわっとした髪が女性に人気が高いヘアスタイル。
	ロングヘアは少しＵＰしてマッシュスタイルにすることで綺麗なシルエットになります。
	サイドは軽めのツーブロックでメリハリをつけ、全体は束感を出せるようにセニングカットを施してきましょう。
	パーマは外ハネとニュアンスを組み合わせたミックスパーマがおすすめ。
	髪型のセット方法
	全体に空気を入れるように乾かしていく。
	その後水分を少し含んだ状態でワックスを揉み込む。
	ワックスが馴染んだら、軽く流れを作っていく。
	毛束はほぐさず、少し大きめぐらいにしておく。
	最後に外ハネを作り、スプレーをかければ完成。

	素直さといえるかもしれない。
	真剣→何か特定の物事に１００％近いエネルギーを注ぐこと。
	遊びではなく取り組んでいること。

	というのが第一印象なわけだが、細かく見ていくと違いがわかってくる。
	真面目の説明には「誠実」という言葉が使われている。
	それは、うそやいいかげんなことがないっていう所とも重なる。
	一方で、真剣には「誠実」に値する言葉が使われていない。
	元が「本物の刀剣」っていう意味だから、お遊びでやってるわけじゃない、っていうのが派生して今の用法になったのだろう。

	ビジネスでは、尊敬語と謙譲語をきちんと使いこなすのがマナーです。
	尊敬語も謙譲後も丁寧語と同様に、敬語ですがその用法は異なります。
	尊敬語は、相手を持ち上げる表現をつかって相手を高めます。
	一方の謙譲語は自分がへりくだる事で、相対的に相手を高めます。
	では、実際のビジネスシーンではどの様に使われるのでしょうか？

	こんな時は尊敬語？謙譲語？
	尊敬語と謙譲語がひととおりマスターできても、時にどちらを使えばよいのか迷ってしまうシーンもあります。
	それは、敬語を使うべき相手が複数いる場合です。
	たとえばお客様に対して自分の上司について話をするには、どうしたらよいのでしょうか？自分にとっては、お客様も上司も尊敬すべき相手です。
	お待たせしているお客様に対して仮に「〇〇課長がまもなくお越しになりますので、お待ちください。」と言ってしまうと、上司に尊敬語を使ったために、お客様は相対的に上司よりも下になってしまいました。
	この場合は、身内である上司の事は謙譲語で扱います。
	「〇〇がまもなく参りますので、お待ちください。」といえばお客様が持ち上がり、正しい使い方になります。

	尊敬語を使うシーン
	尊敬語は、目上の人が動作の主体、主語となる様なときに使います。
	会社では、上司や社長など身分の高い人に使います。
	たとえば、本社の社長が支店に来るという様なシチュエーションの時は、来るという動詞を尊敬語にします。
	「来る」の尊敬語はどんなものがあるでしょうか？複数ありますが、おいでになる、お越しになる、お見えになるなどが良く使われます。
	実際の表現としては、「本社の社長がおいでになります。」と述べると良いでしょう。
	では、逆に本社で社長を見送る立場の場合はどの様な表現になるでしょうか？「社長は支店に出かける」では、敬意が示せません。
	そこで「出かける」の部分を尊敬語にします。
	「社長は支店にお出かけになる」と表現します。
	謙譲語を使うシーン
	謙譲語を使うシーンも、目上の人や敬意を示したい人との関係で使いますが、動作の主体は相手ではなく自分の時に使います。
	たとえば、社長を出迎えに行くという様な場合に、社長に対してその説明をする様な時に使います。
	「社長、私が新幹線のホームまで迎えにいきます。」でも趣旨は通じますが、いまひとつ敬意が感じられません。
	そこで「迎えにいきます」の部分を謙譲語にします。
	「お迎えにあがります。」または「お迎えに参ります」と述べます。
	同様に、営業マンが客を訪問する場合などにも謙譲語はよく使います。
	お客の家を訪問する場合には、「〇〇時に行きます。」の「行きます」部分を謙譲語に変更します。
	「参ります。」または「お伺いします。」を使うと良いでしょう。

	疫病が蔓延してしまったら
	疫病は初期の頃は発祥する葉数が少ないので葉を摘葉して対策することが出来ますが、株全体に疫病が広がってしまった時は、薬剤を使わない場合は株ごと除去するしか手立てはありません。
	マンションなどで数株だけ栽培している時は、株ごと抜き取る事が出来ないことが多いので、その時は薬剤を利用することを検討して下さい。
	生育初期や収穫前の薬剤使用であれば、決められた量と決められた回数を守って使用すれば人体への影響は殆どありません。

	疫病が進行すると病斑にうっすらとした白色のカビが生えます。
	特にトマトに良く発生する病気で被害が大きくなります。

	ナスの疫病（褐色腐敗病）
	疫病は収穫を終えた残渣（ざんさ）の中で越冬して、翌年に適度な温度と湿度になると発芽して胞子が生まれます。
	その胞子が灌水時の泥の跳ね返りによって新しく植えた苗の葉に付着して発病してしまうのです。
	疫病は低温多湿の気候が続くと発生しやすくなります。

	香月さんの所属する会社では、建設業界全体の繁忙は２０１８年には一段落するのではないかと予測している。
	２０２０年に向けた工事需要が落ち着く時期として、業界関係者も同じような予測を立てているという。
	だからこそ、時限的に優秀な人材を確保する工夫が欠かせないのだ。

	建築費の高騰が続いている。
	２０１１年以降、東日本大震災後の復興関連工事需要、安倍政権の国土強靭化計画による公共工事の増加によって建設業界の人件費が上がり続けてきたことが大きな要因だと言われている。
	さらに２０２０年の東京オリンピックに向け、競技会場の建設や道路改修（東名高速道のリニューアル工事など）、電線地中化工事などのインフラ整備が急ピッチで進められ、建築費の高止まりの気配は見えない。
	国土交通省の統計による新築住宅一戸あたりの工事費予定額を見ると、平成２６年計で全国平均１５３９万円（東京都平均は１５１０万円）だったものが、平成２７年５月には全国平均１６１２万円（東京都平均は１８８０万円）に上昇している。
	（出典：国土交通省「住宅着工統計」）
	一方で厚生労働省の統計による建設業の賃金年額平均は、平成２５年度の３１７万円から２６年度は３１９万７０００円に上昇している。
	（出典：厚生労働省「賃金構造基本統計調査」）
	新規の物件着工に不利な今の状況はどこまで続くのだろうか。
	その大きな要因となっている、建設業界の人材難について考えてみたい。

	ここでいうコミュニケーションというのは主に以下の３つのこと
	・相手への気遣い
	・相手への尊敬
	・相手を認めてあげること
	これらが足りなくなると、よっぽどの理由がないかぎり、相手との関係は崩壊します。
	考えてみてください、もしあなたの目の前にいる人が、あなたに対して
	・自分の意見ばかりを押し通そうとしたりして、あなたにはまったく気を使わない
	・あなたの事を、なんだこいつ？といった感じで見下している
	・あなたの事をどうせ、ダメだろ。

	ほめ上手は人生が充実している
	こんなにうまくいく３つの理由
	理由１：ほめるのが上手なひとは、間違いなく異性にモテる
	女性にモテる男性は女性への気遣いがもの凄くじょうずです。
	・さりげなく、アクセサリーや洋服をほめてあげたり、
	・髪型やお化粧の小さな変化に気がついてあげる。
	・お店では、ごく自然にレディーファーストで上着やコートをかけてあげる。
	そういったことをモテる男性は、いつも当たり前にやっています。
	なので相手の女性からしたら、「この人は、わたしを大切にしてくれる」「このひとと一緒にいると心地よい」と感じる
	見た目がカッコいいとか、あのひと面白い、なんて言うのとは全く別の次元で、
	ほめ上手な男性はごく自然に女性の心をつかむことができるんです。
	男性にモテる女性にも同じです。
	・男が見栄を張りたい時に、一歩引いて背中を押して応援してくれる、
	・つまらない仕事や過去の自慢をニコニコ笑顔で聞いて、
	「すごいね」とほめてくれる。
	・ちいさな変化を見逃さずに、フォローしてくれる気遣いがある
	こんなふうにされたら、おとこなら誰だって気分が良くなっちゃいますよね。
	男性と同じでほめ上手な女性は、見た目が可愛い、キレイ、スタイルがうんぬん、なんて言うのは置いておいて

	ですから、ほめ上手なひとは、自然とまわりにひとがたくさん集まってくるのです。
	だってそうでしょう、いつもほめてくれるひとと、いつもケチばかりつけてくるひと、あなたはどっちのひとと一緒に居たいと思います？

	特許庁によると、商標登録の出願があった後で、手数料が支払われると、申請内容の審査が始まる。
	問題がなければ、６ヶ月程度で商標が登録されるという。
	一方、手数料の支払いがなかったり、（１）申請した商標を使った商品、サービスなどが実現する可能性が低い（２）他人が許可なく著名な名称で出願する（３）「五輪」のような公共性の高い名称を出願する−などに該当すると判断されたりした場合、登録が認められない。
	特許庁は、今回の「ＰＰＡＰ」の商標出願問題について、「個別の案件に関してはコメント差し控える」と回答。
	ただ、こうした審査基準に照らせば、大阪府の企業がピコ太郎側から承諾を得ていない場合、商標登録がされる可能性は低い。

	すべてのヌクレオチドの構造は基本的に共通しており、リン酸基、五炭糖、塩基という３つの部分からできています。
	ただし、この中で塩基と呼ばれる部分だけが４種類で異なっているため、４種類のヌクレオチドが存在するのです。
	ＤＮＡを構成しているヌクレオチドには、アデニン（Ａ）、チミン（Ｔ）、グアニン（Ｇ）、シトシン（Ｃ）があります。
	一般的に、これらの４つのヌクレオチドは略して「ＡＴＧＣ」と表記されています。
	テレビや映画などで、遺伝情報を「ＡＴＧＧＧＣＡＴＴＴＡＡＡ」などという形式で表記されたものを見たことはありませんか？
	ＤＮＡとは、「ＡＴＧＣ」の４種類のヌクレオチドが何百万個と並んでできており、その並び方は、生物によって決まっています。
	この「ＡＴＧＣ」の並びのことを「塩基配列」と呼びます。

	つまり、ヌクレオチドがたくさん集まったものがＤＮＡであり、この長いＤＮＡの一部に、遺伝子領域と呼ばれる部分があるのです。
	ＤＮＡとは、生物の細胞や組織を作り上げるのに必要なすべての情報を蓄えた図書館のようなものです。
	この情報は親から子へと、世代を通じて伝えられていくのです。
	しかし、情報が伝えられるといっても、遺伝子が親から子へと伝えられるという言い方は正確ではありません。
	正確には、ＤＮＡが親から子へと伝えられるため、そのＤＮＡ上にある遺伝子も結果的に親から子へと伝えられているのです。
	この遺伝子がＤＮＡ上に存在する状態を「遺伝子がＤＮＡ上にコードされている」と言います。

	人気の理由としては前記事にもある通り
	・シンプル
	・気軽に出来る
	・とにかくラーメンが好き
	の３つが主です。
	細かい戦略やメニューを考えるのではなく一杯のラーメンに命をかける。
	内装外装もシンプルで全てカウンターでも行けちゃうラーメン屋は他と比べて資金もかからないのもあるけど、なによりみんなラーメンが好きなんですよね。

	にんにく、あぶらでコッテリしたスープに、野菜が高々と乗せられかなりの量があり、インパクトがある。
	「美味いものを食わせたい」というラーメン屋目線ではなく、「山盛りラーメンを食べ切りたい」という客目線からみた、客の欲求を満たすラーメンはラーメン界に革命を起こした。
	一蘭
	ラーメンは好きだけど一人で入りづらい
	店員さんが殺伐としてて抵抗がある
	静かにラーメンを楽しみたい
	こんな悩みを一気に解決した一蘭は成功しているラーメン屋の一つです。
	店員が客の前に顔を出すことはなく、まず来店したら自分で好きな席に座る。
	カウンターには左右、正面にまで仕切りがあり落ち着ける空間。
	正面の仕切りの下にはコッソリとした空間が空いており、そこからそっとラーメンが渡される。

	古代ギリシアのアリストテレスは『動物誌』で動物を有血動物と無血動物に大別し有血動物は哺乳類鳥類卵生四足類魚類の四種類無血動物は軟体類甲殻類昆虫類有殻類から構成されると分類していた。
	有血動物は現在の脊椎動物無血動物は無脊椎動物に相当する。
	現在は界門綱目科属種の分類単位がおかれている。
	各階層の他に必要な場合には中間の階層を置くことがある。
	この場合のには「亜」をつけ亜目・亜科などとする。
	たとえばヒトの分類学的位置は動物界脊つい動物門ほ乳綱サル目（霊長目）ヒト科ヒト亜科ヒト属のヒトである。
	学名はＨｏｍｏｓａｐｉｅｎｓＬＩＮＮＡＥＵＳ１７５８である。
	類人猿もヒト科に含まれヒト科とサルの仲間がサル目に含まれる。
	分類の階層を上がるほど違いが大きくなる。
	なお近年は界より上にドメイン（ｄｏｍａｉｎ）を設ける場合がある。

	彼は発生の比較から地球上のすべての生物群は単一の共通祖先に由来すると考えた。
	そして植物界と動物界に二分されていた生物を植物界・動物界・原生生物界に三分した。
	原生生物は単細胞生物であった。

	比較する生物群で似た形質があっても起源を共通にする場合は相同な形質であり起源が異なる場合には相似な形質である。
	系統推定で重視されるのは相同な形質であり相同な形質をもつ生物群はまとめることが出来る。
	また、ある形質が相同か相似かを判断する客観性はなんだろうか。
	一般的に使われているのは変化の少ない判断を採用することである。
	例えば軟体動物のカメラ眼と脊椎動物のカメラ眼は相同だろうか。
	相同だと判断すると下右図の動物界の系統樹でカメラ眼が失われる進化が５回起こったと仮定しなくてはならない。
	相似だと判断した場合にはカメラ眼獲得の進化が２回それぞれ独立に起こったと仮定すればすむ。
	変化の少ない方を採用するという原則からはカメラ眼は相似形質と判断される。
	系統分析の際に、より客観的な方法として提案されたのが分岐分類である。
	分岐分類では、生物のもつ形質を原始的な祖先形質（原始形質）と、新たに出現した子孫形質（派生形質）とに分け、共有派生形質をもつ生物群を同じ系統に属する仲間としてまとめる。
	この派生形質を持つ生物群が、派生形質は持たないが原始形質を共有している生物群と、共通祖先から枝わかれしたと考えて分岐図を作る。
	こうして作成された分岐図は実際の生物の系統関係に近いものと考えられる。

	種は自然の状態で交配が行われ次の世代へ形質を伝えていく繁殖集団であり他の繁殖集団とは生殖的に隔離されている。
	また種は不変のものではなくその中にいろいろな変異を含み時間とともに変化したり新しい種となる種分化の可能性をもっている。
	生物が進化してきた径路が系統であり、この径路を推定し、それから示される生物の類縁関係に基づいて分類するのが系統分類である。
	現在は系統分類が真の自然分類であると考えられている。

	実際に分類するときの実例にそって説明してみよう。
	分岐分類では、内群と外群の生物を比較して派生形質を決定し共有派生形質をもつ集団でクレードを形成する。
	内群とは実際に分析を行おうとしている集団である。
	外群は内群より前に進化したことが明らかな種である。
	内群のメンバーの形質を外群と比較することによって区別点を決めることが出来る。
	たとえば、下左図（略）の例では内群のすべての動物は毛と乳腺をもつ。
	これらの形質は外群のイグアナにはない。
	そこでこの内群は、哺乳類のクレードとまとめることができる。
	しかし内群の動物のなかでカモノハシには母体の子宮で育児をする妊娠がない。
	このことからカモノハシは内群のクレードで初期の分岐をしたと推測することができる。
	分岐分類は進化上の変化つまり分岐点に焦点を当てる方法である。
	分岐分類の結果が従来の分類とちがう結果をもたらす場合がある。

	●第１項人為分類と自然分類
	ギリシャの哲学者アリストテレスは生物を動物と植物に二分しさらに動物を陸生水生空中生活で分けた。
	植物の方は茎の特徴で木本や草本などに分けた。
	生活域や茎の特徴のような特定の性質だけに注目し生物を実用的または形式的なやり方で分類することを人為分類という。
	たとえば茎の特徴からするとカラスノエンドウとオランダイチゴは草本にサクラとエンジュは木本に分類される。
	しかし生殖器官である花の構造を中心とし生物どうしの類縁関係（系統）を考えて総合的に分類すると左右相称花で合弁のカラスノエンドウはエンジュと同じマメ科に放射相称花で離弁のオランダイチゴはサクラと同じバラ科に分類できる。
	このような類縁を正しく反映した分類が自然分類である。
	分類の指標となる形態的要素を形質とよぶが、自然分類をおこなうためには、類縁をよく反映している形質を選ぶ必要がある。
	この作業を形質の重みづけという。

	ニューギニア山中の現地人は１３７種の鳥を識別している。
	分類学者が調べたところその地域に生息する鳥は１３８種で現地人は１種だけをよく似た他の種と混同しているにすぎないことが分かった。
	このように生物に名前をつけて区別することは人間の生活にとって大切であり必要なことであった。
	現在までに約１８０万種の生物に名前が付けられている。
	これらは生物学的にどのように分類されているのだろうか。

	【五界説】いくつに界を分けるのが適当かには他にいくつかの考え方がある（参考）。
	長い間、運動するかしないかによって、動物界と植物界とに二分する二界説によって分類されていた。
	ヘッケルは単細胞生物を重視し、三界説を提唱した。
	ホイタッカーは動物界・原生生物界・原核生物界・菌界・植物界と分ける五界説を提唱（１９５９年）、細胞共生説を提案したマーギュリスも五界説を支持した。
	五界説のすぐれた点は原核生物界を独立させたことにある。
	ウーズはｒＲＮＡの塩基配列をもとに原核生物からメタン細菌などの古細菌を独立させる提案をした（１９７７年）。
	その後の分子生物学的な研究で古細菌は真正細菌よりも真核生物に近縁であることが解明され、古細菌を六番目の界の古細菌界と分類する説と、界よりさらに上位のドメインを設けて、古細菌ドメイン、真正細菌ドメイン、真核生物ドメインとする説が提唱されている。

	【分類の階層】リンネは『自然の体系』の中で似た種を集めて属をつくりさらに目綱に集めるというように分類群をその範囲がしだいに広がっていくような系列に配列して分類の体系をつくった。
	これをリンネの分類の階層という。
	リンネは似た種をまとめて属という分類階級を設けた。
	さらに属をまとめて目目をまとめて綱という分類階級をつくった。

	１．Ｊａｖａとは
	・どんな言語か
	ここしばらくＴＩＯＢＥのランキングで１位を取っている有名言語。
	でも親会社はドナドナされた。
	中間コードにコンパイルされＶＭ上で動作するので移植性が高く、Ｗｅｂ系や組込み系、Ａｎｄｒｏｉｄなど幅広い分野で利用されている。
	でも親会社はドナドナされた。
	そんな言語も今ではプロプライエタリの申し子であるＯｒａｃｌｅさんの持ち物となり、今後どうなっていくかは今ひとつ不透明ドナ。
	・長所
	実行速度はＣに及ばないもののスクリプト言語よりは数十倍速い。
	ガベージコレクション付き言語の中では最速クラス。
	下位互換とクロスプラットフォームが割としっかりしているので、一度コードを書けばそれが広い範囲で長期間利用できる。
	Ｊａｖａ１．４で書かれたライブラリが今でも普通にＪａｖａ６から呼ばれていたりするみたいな。
	・短所
	ＶＭを立ち上げるのに時間がかかるので、一瞬で終わる軽い処理を実行する場合はどの言語よりももっさりした動きになる。
	名前空間とか、型の宣言とか、かなり厳密にやらないといけない。
	ダックタイピングなんてお行儀の悪いこともできない。
	ちゃんとインターフェース書きなさい、とな。
	バグを防ぐという意味では厳密さはありがたくもあるけど、コード量は多くなるしディレクトリ構造は複雑になるので、コードを書く時はＩＤＥがないとやってられない。

	６．Ｃ＃とは
	・どんな言語か
	ＣをインクリメントするとＣ＋＋になる。
	Ｃ＋＋をさらにインクリメントするとＣ＃になる。
	という名前の見た目からＣに近い系統なのかと誤解してしまいそうだけど、実際のＣ＃はＪａｖａのコピー。
	いろんなところがＪａｖａと似ているので（中間コードに翻訳してＶＭで動くところとか、クラスの振る舞いとか）、Ｊａｖａを知っているプログラマはそんなに悩むことなく学習することができる。
	・長所
	ＷｉｎｄｏｗｓでＧＵＩアプリを作ろうと思った場合、けっこういいものが作れる。
	ＳｗｉｎｇほどＵＩ的に（お察しください）な状態にもならず、Ｃ＋＋で作るほどコーディングが（お察しください）な状態にもならない。
	Ｊａｖａよりも後出しの言語である分、クロージャとか型推論とか、Ｊａｖａにはない便利な機能もちらほら付いている。
	実行速度も速い。
	Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓで動かす分にはＪａｖａより若干速かったはず。
	ＩＤＥもＶｉｓｕａｌＳｔｕｄｉｏという鉄板ソフトがある。
	・短所
	Ｍｏｎｏは頑張ってはいるけど、Ｌｉｎｕｘでの動作に関してはそれほど実績がない。
	現状ではＡｐｐｌｅ頼みのＯｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅＣほどではないものの、Ｍｉｃｏｒｏｓｏｆｔ頼みの色が強い。
	そのため、ＭＳコケたら使う場所がなくなったという現象が起こらないとも限らない。
	そう簡単にＭＳが転ぶとは思わないけど、例えばモバイル分野辺りで居場所が確保できるかは少し不透明。
	いい言語なんだけどね。
	Ｊａｖａに似た言語ということで、記述するコードの量は軽量言語と比べると多め。

	番外．Ｓｃａｌａとは
	・どんな言語か
	最近私がハマっている関数型オブジェクト指向言語。
	コンパイルされるとＪａｖａと同じｃｌａｓｓファイルに変換され、ＪＶＭ上で動作する。
	言語のイメージはここを見ればだいたい分かってもらえると思う。
	（ＵＲＬＳ）
	・長所
	Ｊａｖａ並の実行速度とＲｕｂｙ並の書きやすさが合わさり最強に見える。
	Ｊａｖａの資産が使い放題で、Ｅｒｌａｎｇのような並列処理まで合わせ持つのでもう手に負えない。
	コードの量もその辺のスクリプト言語並に短くて済む。
	・短所
	覚えるのにけっこう時間がかかる。
	ＣやＣ＋＋ほどではないけどＪａｖａよりも難易度高め。

	７．Ｏｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅ－Ｃとは
	・どんな言語か
	名前の通り、Ｃにオブジェクト指向を組み込んだ言語。
	まさかこの言語が人気言語を扱う記事の中に登場するようになるとは、数年前までは予想もしていなかった。
	すいません、Ｄ言語より来ないだろうなんて思ってました。
	スティーブ・ジョブズがＭａｃに戻る前あたりから使っているお気に入りの言語。
	人気が出た理由はひとえにｉＰｈｏｎｅ。
	ｉＰｈｏｎｅアプリを作るにはＯｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅ－Ｃを使う必要があったことから利用者が急増していつの間にやらＴＯＰ１０に入るような言語になっていた。
	なぜＣ＋＋じゃなくＯｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅ－Ｃなのか。
	それはジョブズにしか分からない。
	・長所
	Ｃと互換性があるので、Ｃが使えるならＯｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅ－Ｃを学習するのは割と簡単。
	もちろん実行速度も十分に高速。
	ｉＰｈｏｎｅのようなＣＰＵを使い過ぎると電池的に困るような端末はこういう言語が向いてるのかもしれない。
	最近のＯｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅ－Ｃはガベージコレクションも付いてるらしい（今知った）。
	何かと進歩してるのだなぁ。
	・短所
	使いこなすにはＣを知らないといけない。
	ということはＣ＋＋と同じく、学習コストはスクリプト言語とは比べものにならないくらい高くなる。
	記述するコードの量ももちろん多くなる。
	Ａｐｐｌｅ以外の機器で利用されるケースはけして多くないので、もしＡｐｐｌｅが「Ｏｂｊｅｃｔｉｖｅ－Ｃ、やめました」と言ったら一気にマイナー言語に逆戻りすることも考えられる。

	５．Ｐｙｔｈｏｎとは
	・どんな言語か
	彼の名はＰｙｔｈｏｎ（ニシキヘビ）。
	ライバル言語はＰｅｒｌ（改名前はＰｅａｒｌ＝真珠だった）とＲｕｂｙ（ルビー）。
	もっと良い名前はなかったのだろうか。
	インデントを使ったブロックの表現と、プログラマがｓｅｌｆという文字をタイプする能力を格段に向上させる言語仕様が特徴的。
	とてもお行儀が良い言語。
	ＰｅｒｌやＲｕｂｙがＴＭＴＯＷＴＤＩ（それをやる方法は幾通りも存在する）な言語であるのに対して、Ｐｙｔｈｏｎはやり方を１つだけ用意するようにしているところとかがお上品に見える。
	・長所
	簡潔で見やすいコードを書きやすい。
	書きあがったコードを見ると、なんというかどの言語よりもあっさりしているように感じる。
	ＮｕｍＰｙとか数学系のライブラリがけっこう充実している。
	ＭＡＴＬＡＢの代わりに使う人もいるとか。
	あとＧｏｏｇｌｅと仲良しで（Ｐｙｔｈｏｎの神様はＧｏｏｇｌｅで働いている）、ＧＡＥでも利用できたりする。
	・短所
	実行速度はやはりスクリプト言語らしい速度。
	日本ではＰｙｔｈｏｎを使った仕事に出くわすことはあまり多くない。
	Ｗｅｂフレームワークはいくつか存在するけど、Ｗｅｂ系の仕事で見かけることもあまりない。
	参考図書を選ぶ時にリアルなニシキヘビの絵を目にしないといけなかったり、利用している時にあまりかわいくない蛇のアイコンを目にしないといけなかったりすることがあるので、蛇嫌いな人は手を出しづらい言語。

	４．ＰＨＰとは
	・どんな言語か
	正式名称は「ＰＨＰ：ＨｙｐｅｒｔｅｘｔＰｒｅｐｒｏｃｅｓｓｏｒ」（意訳：我はＨＴＭＬを生み出すために在る）。
	ＪａｖａやＲｕｂｙがＷｅｂアプリでも使える汎用的な言語なのに対して、ＰＨＰはその名の通りＷｅｂアプリで使うことを目的として作られた男らしい言語。
	スクリプトレットでＨＴＭＬの中にさらっとプログラムを書きこんで動的なページを作る目的で作られた。
	その後、あれも欲しいこれも欲しいと拡張を続けていったら、いつの間にかもっともらしい言語っぽくなっていた。
	こうした日々拡張を重ねる言語をハウルの動く城式言語と呼ぶ（今考えた）。
	・長所
	初心者がプログラムを学び始めてから動的なページが作れるようになるまでにかかる学習時間の短さは魅力的。
	コードの量も短い。
	環境設定も簡単。
	多くの有料レンタルサーバはＰＨＰを使える環境を用意しているので、仕事じゃなく個人で使う用途でも活躍する機会が多い。
	巷に出回っている求人の量が多いのも魅力。
	ＲｕｂｙやＰｙｔｈｏｎの求人よりも圧倒的に多い。
	但しＰＨＰを使える人の数も多いので仕事が取りやすいかどうかは別の話。
	・短所
	実行速度はスクリプト言語らしい速度。
	Ｗｅｂアプリ以外の場所ではあまり利用されない。
	ので、Ｗｅｂ向け以外の用途で使うためのライブラリとかはそんなに多くない。
	ＰＨＰしか使えないプログラマはＰＨＰｅｒと呼ばれて迫害される決まりになっている。

	３．Ｃ＋＋とは
	・どんな言語か
	Ｃ言語にテンプレートとか、クラスとか、継承とか、多重継承とか、演算子のオーバーロードとか、デフォルト引数とか、その他いろんなパンドラの箱に入っていそうな仕様を取り付けることで出来上がった言語。
	多くの仕様が加わることによって生み出されるコードは混沌としたが、最後には希望が残ったと言われているとかいないとか。
	・長所
	速度はＣと同じく音速。
	その上オブジェクト指向やらスマートポインタやら様々な機能が付加され、Ｂｏｏｓｔなんていう強力という言葉がよく似合うライブラリも使えるので、多彩なコードの書き方ができる。
	ＣでできることはＣ＋＋でもすべてできるので、個人的にはＣ＋＋を使わずにＣを使うというシーンがあまり思い浮かばない。
	・短所
	スマートポインタがいるとはいえガベージコレクションはないのでメモリ管理はやはり面倒。
	学習する際はＣ言語の基本を学んでからＣ＋＋に手を伸ばすような経路が一般的。
	つまり、ただでさえ学習コストが他の言語より高めなＣを学んで、さらにＣ＋＋の概念を学ばないといけない。
	使えるようになるまでかなり時間がかかる。
	主観的な点数を付けると、ＰｙｔｈｏｎやＲｕｂｙの学習コストを１０として、Ｊａｖａを１５、Ｃを２０とすると、Ｃ＋＋の学習はコストが３０くらいかかるような感じ。
	あと、大規模なプロジェクトだとビルドにけっこうな時間がかかるのが割とストレス。

	８．Ｐｅｒｌとは
	・どんな言語か
	古くからＣで書くほどでもないことをさらっと書きたい時に愛用されてきた歴史ある言語。
	銃器で言えばコルト・ガバメントみたいなものだと言えば分りやすいのではないだろうか。
	つまりＣがトンプソンＭ１で、ＰｙｔｈｏｎはベレッタＭ９２くらいということだ。
	十分に手に馴染んでいる銃器をあえて手放すほどの理由をベレッタに感じなければ、コルトを使い続けるのも良いのではないだろうか。
	・長所
	長く使われてきた分、いろんなモジュールが揃っている。
	あと、たいていの環境に入っているので、客先のサーバで作業をしないといけない時とかにも役に立つことがある。
	ＬｅａｒｎｉｎｇＰｅｒｌは読み物としても面白い。
	あとラクダの絵がかわいい。
	・短所
	実行速度はスクリプト言語らしい速度。
	用途的にＰｙｔｈｏｎやＲｕｂｙと被るので、今あえてＰｅｒｌを取る理由というのが個人的には思い浮かばない。
	生粋のＰｅｒｌ使いならきっと流暢な解答を用意してくれると思う。

	２．Ｃ言語とは
	・どんな言語か
	世の中はＣでできている。
	ＷｉｎｄｏｗｓだってＬｉｎｕｘだってアメンボだって、みんなみんなＣでできている。
	プログラミング言語だってＣでできている。
	ＰｙｔｈｏｎだってＲｕｂｙだってオケラだって、みんなＣでできている友達なんだ。
	というように世の中の基板になるところを支えている言語。
	・長所
	有名な高級（？）言語の中では最速の実行速度を誇る。
	なのでスクリプト言語を利用している時に速度が出なくて困ったら、その部分をちょろっとＣで書き直すと平気で１００倍速になったりすることもある。
	何十年も使われてきた歴史ある言語なので、周りにはＣで書かれたいろんな資産がある。
	学習する時に参考になる良いソースを探すのも楽。
	参考図書にも困らない。
	・短所
	ガベージコレクションがないのでメモリ管理を忘れた世代には使いづらい言語。
	コード量も軽量な言語と比べるとかなり多くなる。
	自分で何かソフトを作ることになったとして、ピュアなＣでガリガリ書くというシチュエーションはあまり思い浮かばない。
	Ｃ＋＋を使うような気がする。
	あと移植性が低い。
	たとえばＬｉｎｕｘで動いているコードをＷｉｎｄｏｗｓで動かそうと思ったら、いろいろ書き換えないといけないところが出てくる。
	＃ｉｆｄｅｆＷｉｎｄｏｗｓみたいな。

	１０．ＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔとは
	・どんな言語か
	ブラウザ上で動く言語。
	最近はｎｏｄｅ．ｊｓなんていうサーバサイドＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔなんてものも出てきている。
	ブラウザの世界はどこの国土にも属さない紛争地域になっているので、そこで生息するＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔは周囲からのいろんな要求を受け入れてファットになるか、何も受け入れずに「勝手にしろ」と開き直るかのどちらかを選択する必要があった。
	そこで彼は基本的なことだけをサポートした上で「あとはｊＱｕｅｒｙにでも言えよ。俺に言うな」というスタンスを取った。
	それで彼はあの激戦区の中にいてもハウルの城になることもなく、小さくシンプルなままの姿で居ることができている。
	・長所
	ブラウザ紛争地域で勝者になるには速度を追い求める必要があることから、実行速度は「その辺のスクリプト言語よりもよほど速いんじゃない？」というベンチマークをたたき出すようになっている。
	ＪＩＴがトレーシングで最適化な感じで。
	ＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔは軽量な言語だけど意外と何でもできる。
	オブジェクト指向だろうと、イベント指向だろうと、メタプロだろうと、関数型プログラミングだろうと、割と無理なく実現できる。
	・短所
	メインはブラウザ上で動作する言語なので、用途は限られる。
	間違っても巨大ファイルを操作してデータ処理をしようなんて用途に使うものではない。
	一人前のＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔ使いになるためには、ブラウザの違いに翻弄されて目を血走らせながら「ＩＥがぁ、ＩＥがあぁぁ」と叫ぶ儀式を通過しなければいけない。

	９．Ｒｕｂｙとは
	・どんな言語か
	純粋オブジェクト指向でメタプロでＰｅｒｌとＬｉｓｐが結婚して隔世遺伝が黒魔術で生まれた言語。
	主な出産地は島根県の県庁所在地、松江市。
	小学校の頃に全県の県庁所在地を覚えるように言われた時、どうしても覚えられなかった松江市。
	・長所
	楽しくプログラミングができることを意識しているそうで、あまりプログラマを束縛するようなことはしない開放感溢れる言語仕様になっている。
	作者が日本人なので、言語仕様に関するメーリングリストの議論も普通に日本語で行われている。
	日本人にはその辺が取っつきやすい。
	Ｒａｉｌｓがけっこう便利。
	・短所
	実行速度はスクリプト言語らしい速度。
	ｅｎｄｅｎｄｅｎｄ．．．
	行儀の悪い書き方をしてもあまり怒られない。
	ので、大人数で開発した時に「わるいプログラマＬＶ２６」が混ざっていると混沌としやすい。
	目の届く範囲の少人数チームで使うのが正しい利用法なんじゃないだろうか。

	～売却の手順～
	許可が出て売却可能となった場合は、不動産会社に査定を依頼し契約します。
	【契約】
	売却の方法には売却には仲介と、買取り二種類の方法がありますので、どちらにするか決定して契約をします。
	仲介
	不動産会社が売主から依頼された売却物件の買主を探してくる方法です。
	市場価格の相場で売却することができますが、３カ月前後の期間が必要です。
	仲介で売却をする媒介契約をする場合、ひとつの不動産会社とだけ媒介契約をする専属専任媒介契約と専任媒介契約、複数の不動産会社と不動産売却媒介契約ができる一般媒介契約があります。
	どの媒介契約も、法律で決められた媒介の報酬額は同じで、有効期間は３か月です。
	※注意点専属専任媒介、または専任媒介契約をしているにもかかわらず、他の不動産会社を通して売買契約を締結したり、専属専任媒介しているにもかかわらず、自分で見つけた買主と売買契約を締結したりすると、違約金が発生します。
	買取り
	不動産会社が直接売却物件を買い取り、転売する方法です。
	売却はすぐに済むので便利ですが、売却金額はかなり低くなります。
	農地の場合は、不動産会社が買い取り、区分して宅地として売り出すことがほとんどですので、この方法になることが多いです。
	不動産会社が買い取り、良質な土を業者に売り渡した後、宅地造成を始めるようです。
	【売買契約】
	買い手が見つかったら、いよいよ売買契約をします。
	不動産売買契約書を取りかわし、契約を締結します。
	権利証、実印、３ヶ月以内に発行された印鑑証明書、管理規約書、建築確認通知書、固定資産税納付書、運転免許証、パスポートなど本人確認ができるものなどの書類が必要です。
	また、仲介手数料、印紙税、抵当権の抹消費用、測量費などの経費が必要です。

	農地を売却する場合、その農地が市街化区域内に位置しているか市街化調整区域に位置しているかということと、登記簿謄本の中でどの地目に属しているということで条件が変わります。
	市街化区域で地目が田または畑の場合
	農地転用の手続きは必要ですが、売却は可能です。
	市町村の農業委員会に農地法第５条の届け出を提出することで、所有権移転することができます。
	売却しようとしている農地が市街化調整区域、都市計画区域外、無指定区域のどれかに位置していた場合
	農業委員会からの許可が必要です。
	農業振興地域に指定されていたり、農地以外に転用を認めない地域に位置していた場合は宅地として売却することはかなり困難です。
	一部の市町村では、調整区域の取り扱いが変わり、市街化区域以外でも宅地として使えるように規制が緩和されている地域もあります。
	市町村によって、規制が違いますので、売却予定の農地がある地域の役所にある都市計画課や建設課などに相談する必要があります。
	これは、なるべく効率よく農業経営を行うことを目的に決められているものです。

	ペン先のはずし方
	万年筆のペン先を一晩ぬるま湯につける
	（１）まず準備です。
	万年筆の中に残っているインクを抜きます。
	万年筆の胴軸からペン先を安全に取りはずすことができるように、水またはぬるま湯（４０度以下）をコップに注ぎ、万年筆をペン先から首軸までドップリ漬けた状態でひと晩おきます。
	（※しばらく使用しなかった万年筆は、インクの固形化によってペン先と首軸が固着された状態になっている場合があり、まずはそれを溶解しましょう）
	ご注意１：決して熱いお湯はご使用にはならないでください。
	本体は樹脂製のため変形する恐れがあります。
	形する恐れがあります。
	（２）ひと晩水に漬けておいた万年筆の胴軸を右手で持ちます。
	（３）左手の親指でペン芯（黒の部分）の腹の部分を押さえます。
	（４）左手のひと差し指でペン先の真ん中をしっかりと押さえます。
	（※取りはずす時に、ペン先とペン芯が微妙なズレを生じると、インク流量に不具合が生じるため、ペン先とペン芯は絶対にズラさないよう十分に気を付けてください）
	（５）左手の親指とひと指し指ではさんだペン先を動かさず、右手で掴んでいる胴軸だけをゆっくりと動かしながら回していきます（尻軸からみて時計と反対回り）。
	ご注意２：絶対にペン先を回転させようとしないでください。
	ペン先とペン芯がズレるおそれがあります。
	ご注意３：この時、かなり固く胴軸が動かない場合は、インクが固化した状態か変質または変形している場合がありますで、無理をせず、弊社までご相談ください。
	（６）胴軸をさらに回していくと、まずペン先とペン芯をホールドしている金属部分があらわれ、次にペン芯の最後部が現れます。
	これで取りはずしは完了です。
	新しいペン先の取り付け方は、この順序を逆にして行いましょう。
	新しいペン先を左手の親指とひと差し指ではさんだ状態で、胴軸だけを回転させながら、ペン先を挿入してください。
	まず最初に、お手持ちのペリカン・スーベレーン万年筆は８００か６００かわからないという方のために、ペンのサイズ表を掲示しましたので、こちらのページをご覧ください。
	また下の画像「ペン先の比較表」でご希望のペン先をクリックするだけで、ご希望のペン先の注文フォームまで飛ぶ事ができます。

	シャープ設定の調整（続き）
	次の２つのシャープ設定は重要です。
	半径では、写真にシャープを適用する際のディテールの細かさを指定します。
	半径の値を小さくすると、ディテールの細かいものが多い風景などの写真が美しく仕上がります。
	静物や人物など、それほどディテールの細かくない写真では、半径の値は大きい方が適しています。
	サンプルの写真は、半径が１．０に設定されています。
	ディテールでは、写真の中でエッジを強調する度合いを指定します。
	ディテールの値が高いほどテクスチャの輪郭がはっきりし、値が低いほどピンぼけがなくなります。
	サンプルの写真は、ディテールが２５に設定されています。

	これは、菊の花に鎮痛作用や解毒作用、解熱作用があると考えられているためで、動脈硬化の漢方薬に配合されることもあります。
	日本大学薬学部・理学部の研究では・・・
	食用菊に含まれているクロロゲン酸とイソクロロゲン酸は、動脈硬化などの生活習慣病を引き起こす元凶となる悪玉コレステロールの低下、中性脂肪を低下させる効果があると発表されています。
	「もってのほか」には、クロロゲン酸とイソクロロゲン酸が特に多く含まれているそうです。
	また、山形県衛生研究所では、「もってのほか」の花びらに含まれるヘリアントリオールＣとファラジオールが発ガン予防に優れた効果を示していると実証されています。
	自律神経を安定させる働きも。
	これは、菊花の香りの成分（テルペン）は、リラックス効果が高くイライラを取り除いてくれるためだと言われています。
	最近の研究では菊の花の匂い成分が脳神経の機能を回復し、脳の老化を予防するという研究報告もあります。

	バランス型投信がオススメの理由【１】
	長期＋分散投資なら元本割れは避けられる
	３０年以上のデータから（下図）、１０年間の長期分散投資を続ければ、最終的な投資結果でマイナス（元本割れ）を避けられることがわかる。
	運用成績は１００万円を投資していた場合、平均で１９１万円にもなった。
	ＮＩＳＡ口座なら１０年間なら課税ゼロ。
	ＮＩＳＡの非課税期間である５年間投資（ロールオーバーはしない）だったとしても、マイナスは３８回中３回だけと１割以下の確率でしかない。
	運用成績は１００万円を投資していた場合、平均で１３６万円となった。
	積み立てのように時間を分散して投資すれば、高リスク・高リターンの部類に入る株式型の投信も中リスク・中リターンに近づけることができ、ＮＩＳＡ口座での投資に使える商品となる。
	毎月５万円ずつ積み立てても年間６０万円で、分配金を再投資しても非課税枠は十分に足りる。
	非課税口座の積み立てなら資産形成のペースも早くなる。
	１４年から、ＮＩＳＡを利用した投信の積み立ては、資産形成の最も有力な手段となる。

	通常の口座で取引と比較し、損をすることもある！
	ＮＩＳＡ向きの商品や投資法は、ＮＩＳＡのデメリットに注意し、ＮＩＳＡ口座に不向きな商品や投資法を考えると見えてくる。
	じつはＮＩＳＡで購入した株式や投信が値下がりして損失が確定すると、大きなデメリットが発生する。
	通常の口座なら、損失が出ると他の投資商品で得た利益と相殺（損益通算）して税金を減らせる。
	だがＮＩＳＡの損失は損益通算の対象外。
	通常の口座で若干の利益が出る一方で、ＮＩＳＡ口座内で損失が大きく、トータルではマイナスだったとしても課税されてしまうのだ。
	さらに資産が値下がりしたまま非課税期間の終了を迎えると、取得価格は非課税期間が終了した時の時価に変更（値洗い）される。
	将来の価格回復を期待して一般口座などに移し持ち続け、若干値上がりしたところで売却すると、課税されるのだ。

	制度や運用の相談をするなら大手証券の窓口も候補に
	ＮＩＳＡの難点をどこまでカバーできるか、利用者の多い６種類の金融機関を比較してみた。
	株式投資を念頭に入れるなら、証券会社での開設が絶対条件となる。
	コスト面や品ぞろえではネット証券が有利だ。
	ただし、複雑なＮＩＳＡの説明を受けたい、運用の相談がしたい人は対面の証券や銀行がいい。
	大手証券なら投信の品ぞろえも豊富な上、コストの安いネット取引も併用可能なので有力な候補となる。
	身近で全国展開するゆうちょ銀行は居住地の移転への対応は万全だが、投信の品ぞろえの拡充に期待。

	摂取のポイント
	野菜は茹でたり、煮たりする
	生野菜３００ｇに含まれる食物繊維はおよそ１０ｇ。
	野菜は加熱するとカサが減るので、少量で効率よく食物繊維を補うことができます。
	米やパンは精製していないものを選ぶ
	米なら玄米や七分づき米、パンならライ麦パンや全粒粉パン、小麦胚芽入りのものを選びましょう。
	白より茶色のものの方が、より多く食物繊維を含んでいます。
	和食のお惣菜を積極的に
	きんぴらごぼう・ひじき・切干大根など和食のお惣菜は、食物繊維が多い食材を使用しているものが多いのでおすすめです。

	意外と知られていない危険性
	トランス脂肪酸
	サラダ油にはトランス脂肪酸という成分が含まれており、摂取し続けることによって狭心症や心筋梗塞などの冠動脈性心疾患（ＣＨＤ）になってしまう可能性があります。
	賞味期限が切れていたり、使いまわした古い油にはトランス脂肪酸が多く保有されています。
	さらに、酸化した油はトランス脂肪酸より害が大きいので注意が必要です。
	変な色や匂いがしたら酸化していますので、使わずに処分してしまいましょう。

	サラダ油とは
	サラダ油とは、サラダ用ドレッシングに使用されることを前提とした食用油です。
	また、低温下でも凝固しない食用油でもあります。
	サラダなど、比較的低温で食べるものに油を使い結晶化してしまうと、食感に特有のざらつきがでてきてしまいます。
	それを防ぐために、低温で固化した成分を分離して、低温でも凝固しない油にしています。
	日本農林規格（ＪＡＳ規格）では０°Ｃの環境で５．５時間放置しても濁らない事がサラダ油の条件とされています。

	リノール酸
	サラダ油にはリノール酸という成分が含まれており、このリノール酸自体は私たちに必要な栄養素です。
	このような、私たちがとらなければならない油の成分を必須脂肪酸といい、血中コレステロールを下げる働きがあります。
	しかし、このリノール酸は加熱するとヒドロキシノネナールという神経毒に変わってしまい、脳を萎縮させてしまいます。
	その結果、もの忘れやアルツハイマー病、うつ病になってしまう可能性があるのです。
	また、このリノール酸を過剰に摂取し続けることによって、脳梗塞、心筋梗塞、がんになりやすくなり、アレルギー体質などを引き起こす原因ともなるのです。

	キャンドルの芯に使われていた鉛は発がんの可能性があるとして２００３年にはアメリカにおいて製造禁止となっています。

	火のつけ方ですが、最初が肝心で新品のキャンドルには表面部分のロウが全て溶けるまで、火をつけておくことです。
	途中で消してしまっては最後まできれいに溶けずに残ってしまいます。
	初めにロウを溶かしておいた部分しか溶けないので注意して下さいね。
	最初に使われるなら、夜に電気を消して灯りの代わりに使っていただくとすぐに消すようにはならないと思いますし、薄暗い中での良い香りはとっても精神的に安定する時間です！
	忙しくてスパに行けないという方には１時間自宅使っていると同程度の効果があります。
	４．キレイな炎を作る
	火の灯りが一定でない時には調整します。
	きれいに燃やすためには０．５ｃｍほどがベストです。
	長すぎるのはよくありませんので長ければハサミで芯を切って調整します。
	キレイな炎だと最後まで使える事が出来ます。
	いつでもすぐに使えるように灯りの調整は重要です。
	あっては困ることですが、もしもの災害時には停電になったりすることもありますが、そういう時にもアロマキャンドルを使うというのもあります。
	普通のロウソクより太く安定していますし、そこに不安な時間もアロマの香りで少しでも解消できるのではないかと思います。

	建設が始まったのは文明１４年（１４８２年）の事です。
	銀閣寺が建った歴史背景
	１０年も続いた応仁の乱で人々はかなり疲弊、土地はボロボロの状態でしたが、
	その５年後から銀閣寺の建設が始まりました。
	当時は今よりも技術が無かった為、まだまだ土地は回復せず、
	人々も心が晴れるにはすごく時間がかかっていたでしょう。
	建設はそれから８年も続けられ、足利義政が亡くなる直前にやっと終わったそうです。

	「手ぶれ」も「被写体ぶれ」も、共に暗いシーンで起きやすくなります。
	この画像は日没直前の暗い状況で撮ったもので、そのために１／２５秒というかなり長い時間シャッターを開いていたために生じた手ぶれ現象です。
	なお、「手ぶれ」と「被写体ぶれ」以外にも「ぶれ」の生じる場合があります。
	その多くは振動によるもので、自動車の走る橋の上から景色を撮る場合、三脚を据えていても橋の振動による「ぶれ」が生じます。
	あるいは、一眼レフカメラなどの場合、カメラ内部でミラーが動く振動が問題になる場合や、天体撮影などでは人体には関知できない地面の微かな振動さえもが「ぶれ」の原因となります。

	「ピンぼけ」に代表される「ぼけ」
	これは、よく起こりがちなピンぼけの画像で、左は元画像の一部をトリミングで切り取ったもの、右は更にその一部分を２倍拡大したものです。
	この画像では、背景にピントが合ってしまいました。
	そんな場合のことを、「ピントが抜ける」という言い方をすることもあり、ピンぼけの起きる典型的なパターンのひとつです。
	また被写体より後ろ側にピントがずれてしまった場合を「後ピン」、手前側にピントがずれてしまった場合を「前ピン」などとも呼びます。
	でもちょっと待って下さい。
	もしこの写真が背景の景色を撮ったものだとすれば、この写真は「ピンぼけでもないんじゃないか？」と思いませんか？
	その通りなのです。
	「ピンぼけ」は、撮りたい被写体にピントの合っていない状態のことですから、同じ写真でも何を撮ったのかによって解釈が変わるかも知れません。
	とはいえ、たいていの場合は写真を見ればなにを撮りたかったのかは明らかですから、ピンぼけ写真は誰が見てもはやりピンぼけ写真なのです。
	それよりはむしろ、どこまでぼけていたら「ピンぼけ」と呼ぶか、そちらの方が個人差が大きいかもしれません。
	写真を見慣れている人の方が厳しく判定するのが普通です。
	また、「ピンぼけとまでは呼ばないけれども、やはり少しピントがずれている」というような状態を「ピントが甘い」というような言い方をします
	たとえばポートレート写真の場合、ピントは目に合わせるのが基本とされています（真正面から写すのでない場合は手前側の目）。
	それがたとえば、耳にピントが合ってしまったら、「ピントが甘い」と言われるか、それとも「ピンぼけ」と呼ばれてしまうかも知れません（ポートレート写真の世界はピントに対してすごく厳しいのです）。
	また、二人の人物のスナップを撮ったのに、片方の人にしかピントが合っていないというような場合もあります。
	それは、ピントを合わせる位置というより、ピントを合わせる範囲を失敗した結果で、やはり「ピンぼけ」の一種と言って良さそうです。
	なお、特殊なことまで考えれば「ぼけ」の種類（原因）は「ピンぼけ」以外にもありそうですが、普通の状況で起きるのは「ピンぼけ」だけと考えて良いでしょう。

	画像が不鮮明になることや、暗いシーンで起きやすくなることは同じですが、「ピンぼけ」と「手ぶれ」は原因も結果も異なる現象です。
	ピンぼけ・手ぶれレスキューのフィルターを上手に活用するためには、この区別を理解しておいた方が良いでしょう。
	まず、それぞれの現象の起きた画像を検討してみましょう。

	「手ぶれ」に代表される「ぶれ」
	これは、よくありそうな手ぶれの画像で、左は元画像を縮小して一部をトリミングで切り取ったもの、右は一部分を２倍拡大したものです。
	「ぶれ」は、カメラのシャッターが開いている間に、被写体や背景が相対的に静止していなかったために起きる現象です。
	「相対的に静止していなかった」と書きましたが、被写体が静止しているのにカメラの方が動いてしまう場合と、カメラの方は静止しているのに被写体の方が動いてしまう場合があります。
	このうち、カメラが動く、即ちカメラを持っている手が動いてしまった結果に生じるのが「手ぶれ」現象です。
	被写体の輪郭などで、上記右の拡大画像のように、「ぶれた方向に対して」幅のある輪郭が生じてしまうのが特徴です。
	また、写った画像全域で、像が流れるようにぼけてしまいます（上記左の画像では、背景もなんとなく流れているのが確認できると思います）。
	また、被写体の方が動いてしまって「ぶれ」が起きる現象のことは、「動体ぶれ」または「被写体ぶれ」などと呼ばれ、スナップ写真などではありがちな現象です。
	この場合には、写った画像の中で動いてしまった被写体だけが「ぶれ」て写り、背景などは「ぶれ」ずに写ります。
	なお、動く被写体にあわせてカメラを向ける角度も動かして撮る方法もあり、かなり難しい技術ですが、そのような撮り方のことを「流し撮り」と言います。
	流し撮りが成功した場合には、被写体とカメラは相対的にほぼ静止していますので、被写体はぶれず、逆に背景が流れるような迫力ある画像を得ることができます。
	そして、カメラも被写体も共に動いてしまう場合もあります。
	「流し撮り」のように被写体の動きとカメラの動きが一致することは偶然ではまずあり得ませんので、手ぶれと被写体ぶれが合わさった複雑にぶれた画像となります。
	「複雑にぶれる」とは、まず背景のぶれの方向と被写体のぶれの方向が一致せず、被写体が人物だとすれば人物は単純に平行移動するわけではありませんから、体の部分部分でぶれの方向が異なるのが普通です。
	上記の画像でも、幅のある輪郭が一定方向へ向いていることと背景も同じ方向へ流れていることから、ぶれの大半は「手ぶれ」であることは確かですが、ことによると多少は「被写体ぶれ」の要素も混じっているかもしれません。

	食品サンプル型取り手順５
	固まった型取りシリコンを段ボール枠から取り出します。
	食品の埋め込まれた豆腐のようなものができています。
	食品サンプル型取り手順６
	食品を取り外します。
	水で流すなどしてできるだけきれいに取り去る
	水分を残さないようにする
	できるだけ取り出す穴をあけ過ぎないのがポイントです。
	また、食材の裏に塗ったコーキングが固まっていなくて手に付くことがあるので注意。
	食品サンプル型取り完成
	これで型取りは完成です。
	もったいない感じもしますが、取り出した食べ物を食べるのはやめておきましょう。

	食品サンプル型取り手順１
	食品のまわり１ｃｍくらいの枠を段ボールで作ります。
	この時、大きすぎると後で型取りシリコンが余計に多く必要になったり食品サンプルを取り出しにくくなるので最低限の大きさで十分です。
	内側はテープで覆います。
	（後で型取りシリコンが固まった後段ボールを取り外しやすくするため。）
	また、テープはしっかりと隙間なく覆いましょう。
	そうしないとこの画像のように、後で型取りシリコンを流したときに漏れてしまいます。
	では、完成形はこんなイメージ
	このオレオのように２つ分一気に作るのもよいです。
	食品サンプル型取り手順２
	段ボールで作った枠と食品をコーキングシリコンでくっつける。
	食品の底にコーキングシリコンを塗って段ボールで枠にくっつけます。
	（コーキングガンの使い方）
	これは、型取りシリコンを流し込んだときに食品が浮いてくるのを防ぐため。
	浮いてしまうと型取りは失敗してしまうので浮かないようにしっかりくっつけましょう。
	これはマカロンですが悪い例、失敗して食べられないし型もできないし
	食品サンプル型取り手順３
	食品がしっかりくっつけられたら型取りシリコン
	と硬化剤をよくかき混ぜてから
	食品をくっつけた段ボール型に流し込みます。
	このとき、型取りシリコンと硬化剤の割合を間違えると硬化不良を起こしたり早く固まりすぎてしまったりするのでしっかり量を測って混ぜましょう。
	割合は型取りシリコンによって違いますが１ｋｇに対して４０ｍｌのパターンが多いようです。
	また、何度かやってみて気付いたのですが、一度にたくさんの型をとってしまった方が作業効率も良いですし、型取りシリコン１ｋｇにセットになってる硬化剤１瓶をまるまる入れてしまえば計りを使わないで比率も間違えることなくできます。
	さらに、何度も作業スペースを汚す
	リスクも起きませんので
	食品サンプル職人
	今日は食品の型をとる日だ！
	と決めてしまって一気にたくさんの食品の型取り作業をしてしまうのがおすすめです。
	食品サンプル型取り手順４
	このまま水平なところにおいて８時間程固まるのを待ちます。

	■２．「開く」と「デザインビュー」の違い
	例えば、製品のデータを修正したいとします。
	その時は、「製品マスタ」を右クリックして、「デザインビュー」をクリックします。
	「デザインビュー」は、構成や内容です。
	入っているデータを見たい場合は、「開く」をクリックします。
	必ず、それぞれの個別のテーブルやクエリは「開く」と「デザインビュー」を持っています。
	もうひとつ「フォーム」と「レポート」には「レイアウトビュー」がありますが、覚える必要はないと思います。
	「デザインビュー」でその内容を修正します。
	「開く」でデータを見ます。
	テーブルの「デザインビュー」の例です。
	データの項目を定義しています。
	テーブルのデータです。
	「開く」をクリックすると表示されます。
	データの中身です。

	１．アクセスは、簡単、便利で安い？
	アクセスは、ＶＢ（ビジュアルベーシック）などに比べると、簡単、便利で価格の安いソフトです。
	ＶＢ（ビジュアルベーシック）、Ｃ＋＋（シープラスプラス）、Ｃ＃（シーシャープ）などでプログラムを作成する場合、別途、データベースを準備する必要があります。
	また、帳票を作成するにはレポートのソフトも別に準備する必要があります。
	でも、アクセスには、データベースになるテーブルから、画面になるフォーム、帳票になるレポートなどシステムに必要な殆どの機能があります。
	このアクセスで企業の小規模なシステムは殆ど開発することができます。
	そして、アクセスのソフトは、２万円ちょっとで購入することができます。
	安いですね。
	２万円で、システムが出来るんです。
	でも、でも・・・・
	２．でもアクセスでのシステム開発は難しい？
	多くの人がアクセスを勉強しています。
	アクセスの市販の参考書もたくさん販売されています。
	いろいろな通信講座や通学講座があります。
	でも、一般的に、システム開発会社の方を除いて、アクセスをマスターしてシステムを開発している人は、多くはいません。
	何故でしょうか？

	傾向としては、売買価格が年々下落しており、長期的な展望における農業への不安から、買い手の減少が最大の理由です。
	農地に限らず売買の対象においては、買い需要が売り需要を下回れば価格は下がり、逆なら上がりますので、農地は売り需要が勝っている現状と言えます。

	転用して売買する場合の注意点
	農地転用には２種類あります。
	農地の所有者が自ら農地以外の用途で使用する目的
	他者への売買を目的
	農地の所有者が自ら使用するための転用は、農地法４条による転用許可で、売買が目的の農地法５条による転用許可とは扱いが異なります。
	ただ、最終的に他者へ売却するのなら、２つの違いは転用のタイミングに過ぎません。
	先に転用してから売却するか、売却と同時に転用するかという違いです。
	転用はどちらが先でも同じように思えますが、転用許可の制度上、単に転用する許可申請は認められず、転用後の事業計画を必要とします。
	例えば、「とりあえず農地から宅地や雑種地にしておき、後から買主が現れるまで待つ」というような転用許可申請は認められません。

	農地売買の手数料
	農地として売る場合、個人間売買や農業関連機関の斡旋（あっせん）を利用する形態が主で、手数料は登記費用（登録免許税や司法書士報酬）くらいしか発生しません。
	転用による売買では、不動産会社に仲介依頼して売買できるので、登記費用の他にも不動産会社に対して仲介手数料を支払います。
	転用による売買では、転用前提であることを明示すれば、転用許可後に地目変更できるので、農地であっても宅地や雑種地同様に買いやすく、広く買主を探せます。
	したがって、売買価格も農地のまま売るよりも高くなることが想定され、不動産会社への仲介手数料も多くなります。

	農地売買の大まかな流れ
	どのような農地売買でも、売買契約は農業委員会の許可を前提として締結されます。
	農地として売るなら農地法第３条による売買（所有権移転）許可、農地以外で売るなら農地法第５条による転用許可です（届出の場合もあります）。
	農地売買では、通常の不動産取引ではあまりない、「仮登記」を行うのが通常です。
	許可を条件とした売買契約を締結
	農業委員会に許可申請
	許可前に所有権移転請求権仮登記
	許可後に代金支払いと所有権移転登記（本登記）
	２．の農業委員会への許可申請と３．の仮登記は、順番が前後することに問題はなく、どちらも売買契約締結後、遅滞なく行う条項を１．の売買契約書に盛り込みます。
	また、３．仮登記は売買契約の絶対条件ではないですが、４．の許可まで買主が所有権を得られないために、買主による将来の確実な所有権移転を保全する目的で行われます。
	許可されると農業委員会から許可指令書が交付され、許可指令書がなければ農地の所有権移転登記は受け付けてもらえません。
	許可のない違法な所有権移転を防ぐために、このような仕組みになっています。

	農地売買の相場
	一言で農地といっても、都市近郊型の農地から山間部の農地まで広く、同じ規模の農地でも、売買価格が異なって当然です。
	そこで、全国農業会議所が公表している、田畑売買価格の調査結果を１つの目安として、どのくらいで取引されているか確認してみました。

	地域	田	畑
	純農業地域	１２７．０万円	９２．４万円
	都市的農業地域	３５８．９万円	３４６．７万円
	平成２７年田畑売買価格等に関する調査結果（平成２８年３月２１日発表）
	「純農業地域」とは、かんたんに言えば農村部（非線引き区域の農用地区域）で、「都市的農業地域」とは都市部周辺部（市街化調整区域の農用地区域）です。
	１０アールは１０００ｍ２で３０２．５坪ですから、価格の高い都市的農業地域でも、平均値で坪１万円強の世界です。

	農地を売買するからには、利用目的の主体が買主にあるため、売買での転用許可申請は、売主と買主の両方が申請者になり、おおむね次のような基準で判断されます。
	申請目的を実現できる資力や信用がある
	転用する農地の関係権利者から同意を得ている
	転用許可後速やかに申請目的のために使う見込みがある
	許認可が必要な事業で許認可を受けられる見込みがある
	事業のために必要な協議を行政と行っている
	転用する農地と一体に使用する土地を利用できる見込みがある
	事業の目的に適正な広さの農地である
	周囲の農地等への影響に適切な措置を講じる見込みがある
	一時的な転用では農地に戻されることが確実と認められる
	これらの条件から、「きちんと使えないなら転用させません」と分かります。

	農地を農地以外にするための条件
	農地から農地以外の土地に変更することを転用と呼び、残念ながら転用はすべての農地で可能になっていません。
	許可されるかどうかは、「立地基準」と「一般基準」という２つの基準が関係します。
	「立地基準」とは、農地の区分で許可・不許可を決めるもので、優良で大規模な農地ほど許可されず、市街地に近いほど許可されやすくなります。
	農用地区域内農地：原則不許可
	甲種農地：原則不許可
	第１種農地：原則不許可
	第２種農地：周辺の他の土地に代えられなければ許可
	第３種農地：原則許可
	立地基準から、第２種農地と第３種農地以外は原則不許可で望み薄です。

	サービス面では中小のほうが優れてる場合も：
	反面、大手のクレジットカード会社にはクレジットカードそのものの魅力が乏しいケースが多くなっています。
	理由は単純で、大手には信用力と知名度があるので、そんなにもサービスを強化しなくても勝手に利用者が集まるためですね。
	大手カード会社：サービスやポイント制度を強化しなくても申込者が集まる
	中小カード会社：サービスやポイント制度を強化しないと申込者が集まらない
	その点、中小のクレジットカード会社のほうがポイントが溜まりやすかったり、年会費無料のクレジットカードを積極的に発行していたりと様々な魅力があります。
	まぁそういった強みを持たないとカード利用者を集められない．．．というのが実情でしょう。

	例えば私が現在利用しているダイナースクラブプレミアムカードはポイント還元率２％（マイル１．５円換算で３％還元）というとんでもなく素晴らしいカードなんですが、このカードの年会費は１０万円以上（苦笑）。
	ポイント獲得で年会費の元取るのはほぼほぼ不可能な状況です。
	年会費無料のカード
	ポイント獲得分すべてが得をするクレジットカードです。
	年会費無料のクレジットカードでポイント還元率が高いものがあればそれがベストですね。
	楽天カード、ライフカードあたりが最近の主力です。
	年会費有料のカード
	年間のポイント獲得金額から年会費を差し引いてポイント還元率を計算しなくてはいけません。
	例えば年間利用金額が１００万円で２万円分のポイント獲得、年会費１万円なら差し引き１万円の得で、ポイント還元率は１．０％になります。

	１．年会費で選ぶ：
	クレジットカードを比較する上で一番カンタンなのが「年会費」。
	年会費というのはそのクレジットカードを１年間、保有するためにかかる会員費のことです。
	年会費とは、クレジットカードを１年保有するためにかかる費用のこと
	この年会費は０円、つまり無料に設定されているものから、富裕層向けの年会費３０万円以上かかるクレジットカードまで存在。
	クレジットカードを持つために年会費なんて払いたくない．．．という方は、まず、年会費無料のクレジットカードの中から選ぶようにしてください

	５．付加価値で選ぶ：
	５つ目はこれ、付加価値で選ぶこと。
	ここまでいくつかの付加価値を書いてきましたが、代表的なクレジットカードのサービス内容をいくつか紹介しておきます。
	海外旅行傷害保険
	クレジットカードを持っているだけで、海外旅行傷害保険に加入していることになるサービス（自動付帯の場合）。
	海外での事故や急な病気などでの治療費が出たり、トラブル発生時の損害賠償に対応してくれます。
	海外旅行によく行く方に人気です（無料で海外旅行保険に加入する方法はこちら）。
	国内旅行傷害保険
	クレジットカードを持っているだけで、国内旅行傷害保険に加入していることになるサービス（自動付帯の場合）。
	ただ海外旅行傷害保険とは異なり、適用になるのは事例はかなり少ないので、万が一、事故死してしまった場合など、自分の家族への補償くらいに考えておいたほうが無難かもしれません。
	空港ラウンジ無料
	日本国内を飛行機で旅をする方に人気な空港ラウンジ無料サービスも人気です。
	飛行機の搭乗時間までの隙間時間を有効活用できるので、ビジネスマンの方におすすめですね。
	プライオリティパス無料
	日本国内だけではなく海外にも飛行機で行くことが多いという方に人気の空港ラウンジサービスです。
	国際空港ならほとんどの場所で使えるので、海外旅行や海外出張時に重宝します（プライオリティパス付きカードの一覧はこちら）。
	高級レストラン半額
	フレンチやイタリアン、お寿司屋さんなどの高級レストランが最大半額になるサービスです。
	グルメ好きの方に特に人気ですが、主に東京や大阪などの都市部にしか割引対象レストランがないのがデメリットです。
	ゴルフ場割引
	憧れのゴルフコースに予約できるサービスや、特定ゴルフコースの割引があるクレジットカードは多いです。
	ゴルフを安くしたい、有名ゴルフ場でプレイしてみたい．．．というゴルファーの方向けですね。
	コンシェルジュサービス
	飛行機チケットを取ってほしい、あのレストランの予約をしておいてほしいなど、自分の秘書がわりに使うことが出来るコンシェルジュサービスも人気。
	基本、カード決済ができるものならなんでもわがままを聞いてくれるのでラクです。
	これらの付加価値概要を読んでピンと来た方は付加価値でカードを選ぶのがおすすめ。
	逆にどれを読んでも「私には関係ないな．．．」と思われた方は、年会費の安さ（無料かどうか）でクレジットカードを選ぶほうが良いかもしれません。

	「国際ブランドって？」という方のためにカンタンに説明すると、国際ブランドとはＶＩＳＡやＭａｓｔｅｒＣａｒｄ、ＪＣＢといったクレジットカードのカテゴリのこと。
	これら３つに加えて、アメックス、ダイナースクラブなどを加えた５つが世界５大ブランドと言われています。
	ＶＩＳＡやＪＣＢといったクレジットカードの国際ブランドまとめ！それぞれの特徴や、どの国際ブランドを選ぶべきかの比較方法などを解説。
	例えば海外旅行や海外出張に頻繁に行く．．．という方は、ＶＩＳＡの国際ブランドが付いたクレジットカードを作るのがおすすめ。
	有名なクレジットカードだと三井住友ＶＩＳＡカードがありますね（公式サイトはこちら）。
	他にも日本国内での利用を重視したい．．．という方であればＪＣＢブランド付きのクレジットカードを選んだり、とにかくステータス性重視でクレジットカードを選びたいならアメックスやダイナースクラブ．．．といったように、それぞれの国際ブランドには特徴があります。
	ＶＩＳＡかＭａｓｔｅｒＣａｒｄが無難：
	ただ２０１６年現在でいえば、ＶＩＳＡかＭａｓｔｅｒＣａｒｄブランド付きのクレジットカードを選ぶのが最適なので、どれを選んで良いのかわからない．．．という方はこの２つのうちのどちらかのマークが入ったクレジットカードを選べばＯＫ。
	敢えてＪＣＢやアメックスなどを選ぶ必要性はありません

	参考までに大手クレジットカード会社と準大手のクレジットカードをリストにしておきます。
	あくまで私の主観による分類なので、人によっては楽天カードやイオンカードを大手クレジットカード会社に分類する方もいることでしょう。
	大手クレジットカード会社例：
	ＪＣＢカード
	三菱ＵＦＪニコス
	三井住友カード
	クレディセゾン
	セディナなど
	準大手クレジットカード会社例：
	楽天カード
	イオンカード
	トヨタファイナンス
	オリコカード
	エポスカードなど
	このように大手クレジットカード会社と中小クレジットカードには違いがあります。
	安心さを取るか、それともクレジットカード自体の魅力を取るかは．．．みなさんの判断にお任せしますが、初めてクレジットカードを作る方なら、まずは大手か準大手カード会社で作るのが無難かもですね

	アコギのパンの広げ方は、各音の周波数帯によりますので、やはり色々と試してみる事が大切です。

	例えば、ロックのドラムなどではあまりパンを広げ過ぎると、確かにシンバルが広くなって豪快に聴こえるようですが、少しセンターと左右のスピーカーの真ん中辺りに穴が目立ってしまったりすることもあります。
	中抜けなイメージですよね。
	逆に、広がりのある音数の多い楽曲でエレピの伴奏をステレオ録音して、そのパンを放置していたら、ミックス全体がごちゃごちゃしてしまったりもします。
	では、どの様なパン振りをしたらいいのでしょうか？？
	まず、基本的にはキックとスネア、ベース、ボーカルはセンターに定位している事が多いと言えます。
	もちろん、ドラムを全て片方のチャンネルに振り切ってしまう、ビートルズが試していたようなミックスもありますが、ここではオーソドックスなパンについて説明していきます。
	それではセンターに位置するもの以外の楽器はどの様に配置していくのがいいのでしょうか？

	バスドラムとスネアは中央
	ハイハットは左（Ｌ８０～９０くらい）か右（Ｒ８０～９０）、お好みで。
	中央でも良い
	ライドシンバルはハイハットの逆、若干内側（ハイハットがＬ８０だとしたら、ライドはＲ６０みたいな）
	クラッシュシンバルは２つあるはずなのでそれぞれ左右に振る（７０くらい？）
	タムはハイタムからフロアタムに向かってハイハットのパンの位置から反対側に向かって置いていくハイハットがＬ８０だとしたら、ハイタムがＬ５０、フロアタムがＲ３０みたいな
	スプラッシュシンバルやチャイナシンバルはキットの位置から連想してお好みで、中央でも良い
	基本的な考え方はドラマーを中心としてハイハットが左にあるか、観客を中心にしてハイハットが右にあるかどうかを想像した上で、ドラムキットのキットピースの位置関係を再現するように振ることです。
	例外としてスネアとバスは常に中央に置きます。
	この位置関係を考えると、ハイハットが左右にあって、タムがそこから反対側に流れていくことや、クラッシュシンバルを左右に振る理由がわかると思います。
	ただし、メジャーなアーティストの音源だとハイハットが中央にあるのも結構主流ですので、「聴いてみて良かった感じ」をご自身で判断するのが良いでしょう。

	また、８月末に行われた鎌倉音楽祭のライブレコーディングでは、キック・スネア・ハイハットのベーシックな３点とシンバル類、コンガ３つ、ジャンべ、カホン、そして鳴り物類多数という相当な数の編成でした。
	この時、キックは中心に、しかしスネアはセンターから少しずらす事でボーカルとのマスキングを少し抑え、ハットと他のパーカッション類は右手奥で鳴らして、カホンのみ例外で曲により中心やパーカッションと同じ場所、時には左手側に配置したものもあります。
	ＴｏｋｙｏＦＭで今月５日に１時間だけダイジェストで放送されたのですが、番組枠を拡大して再放送の話などもちらほらと聞きますので、もしも放送される事になりましたら是非聴いてみてください。
	聴いて頂くと、ライブレコーディングのミックスで私がいかに苦戦したかが分かると思います（笑）
	他、ＴＯＫＹＯＭＸテレビやＮＴＴぷらら、ＢＳＴｗｅｌｌＶなどでも放送が決まっておりますので、どこかで機会があったらチェックしてみてください。
	是非、その際はテレビの出力をスピーカーに出してパンを確認してください！！
	話が逸れましたが、もうひとつだけ例を挙げてみましょう。
	アコギ弾き語りのアーティストさんがいらっしゃったとして、アコギをラインで１本、ボーカル１本の両方をセンターからモノで出したとします。
	これはかなりＥＱとコンプでアコギを犠牲にしないといけなくなるはずです。
	しかし、センターから少しでもアコギをずらしてあげたり、マイク２本で録っているならば少しステレオで広げてアコギの中心をボーカルのあるセンターからずらしてあげる事で一気に解決できるはずです。

	まず簡単な方法として、
	【１】両手を肩にあてそのままヒジを大きくぐるぐると回すものです、前まわしと後ろまわしを５回くらいおこないましょう。
	【２】両手を上にあげ、手の平を内側に向けます。
	そのままひじを開くように腕をおろし背中を引き締めます。
	その時に、手の平を外側に向けるようにしましょう。
	肩甲骨を動かすことが目的になります。
	（１０回を２セット程度）
	【３】腰に掌を外側に向けた状態で添えて、両ひじを背中の後ろでつけるような気持ちでパタパタとさせます。
	もちろん、肩甲骨を意識して行います。
	（１０回を２セット）
	【４】最後にもう一度、両手を方にあててひじを大きくぐるぐる回すを、前まわしと後ろ周りで５回くらい行います。

	旅行に行けば写真をたくさん撮ることになりますが、そうした旅行写真をお金に変える方法があります。
	ｉＳｔｏｃｋ、Ａｌａｍｙ、Ｓｈｕｔｔｅｒｓｔｏｃｋ、ＧｅｔｔｙＩｍａｇｅｓなどのサイトを利用すれば、撮りためた写真を簡単に販売することが可能です。
	サイトに写真をアップロードしておくだけで、あなたの写真を気に入った企業や個人から、写真を買いたいと連絡がやってきます。
	スマートフォンから写真を直接アップロードできるＦｏａｐというアプリもあります（ｉＯＳとＡｎｄｒｏｉｄでは無料）。
	このアプリの特徴は、企業側が特定の国や都市、地域を撮影課題として投稿しているところです。
	自分が今いる場所や地域にまつわる課題を探し、写真を撮って応募します。
	買い手がつくかはわかりませんが、使ってみるだけでも面白いアプリです。
	ＧｏＰｒｏを持っていれば、ＧｏＰｒｏが主催する「風変わりな交通手段」や「旅先のストーリー」といった旅行向きのコンテストに参加するのもあり。
	毎日、優秀作品が選ばれ、写真なら５００ドル、撮りっぱなしの動画なら１０００ドル、編集した動画なら５０００ドルの賞金がもらえます。
	入賞するのは大変ですが、写真を撮る楽しみが増え、写真の腕も自ずと上達するはずです。
	荷物を運ぶ
	車の旅なら、道すがらに荷物（ペットも！）を運んでお金を稼ぐこともできます。
	Ｒｏａｄｉｅは、特定の場所へ荷物を運んで欲しい人とドライバーをつなげるサービスです。
	長距離になれば報酬が１００ドルを超えるケースも。
	ＣｉｔｉｚｅｎＳｈｉｐｐｅｒはペットに特化した同様のサービスです。
	こちらはドライバー側が入札する仕組みです。
	たとえば、こちらの案件は、顧客が「とても人なつっこい犬」をロサンゼルスからジョージアに運んで欲しいと言っています。
	この依頼に３人のドライバーが４００ドルで入札しています。
	どちらのサービスも運転免許証や自動車保険の確認が求められます。
	国をまたいだ旅行ならＷｏｒｌｄＣｒａｚｅを試してみるのもあり。
	これは、旅行者が自国で預かった荷物を目的地の国にいる人に届けるのを仲介するサービスです。
	目的地の都市と旅行日を入力すれば、該当する案件情報が表示されます。
	依頼主との間で交渉がまとまると、ＷｏｒｌｄＣｒａｚｅが１０％の仲介手数料をとります。

	鼻の洗浄方法と簡単に言いましたが、見た目のインパクトが非常に強いのが特徴。
	何より、広告ビジュアルが強烈でした。
	あるユーザーが電車内でハナノアの広告を目の当たりにし、その衝撃を画像とともに伝えたツイートは、１万以上もリツイートされることに。
	この広告、確かに見過ごすことのできないインパクトです。
	電車のなかなど「笑ってはいけない」状況で見てしまうと、堪えきれずにＳＮＳに投稿したくなってしまう気持ちもわかります。
	■鼻に水が入ったときに感じる痛みをクリア
	この、片方の鼻の穴から液体を入れて、反対の鼻の穴から出す製品は、「ハナノアシャワータイプ」。
	洗浄器具を押す圧力で、洗浄液をシャワー状に鼻に流し込みます。
	ここで気になるのが、プールなどで鼻に水が入ったときに経験するツーンとした痛みです。
	花粉もツラいが、あの痛みもツラい。
	そこで痛みを回避するために、同製品では人間の鼻がツーンとならないような、体液に近い成分で構成されているのです。
	なるほど、それなら安心。
	さらに体液にはミントの香りも付いています。
	鼻が痛くなるどころか、むしろスッキリ爽やかな気分になるという寸法です。
	さて、そんな鼻うがい製品「ハナノア」ですが、この広告を作る際にどのような狙いがあったのでしょうか。
	まだまだ一般的に馴染みのない鼻うがい。
	「それを周知し、簡単に痛みなく洗浄できることを知ってほしかった」と小林製薬の広報担当者がこたえてくれました。
	“鼻うがい”という行為はまだ一般に馴染みがなく、方法としても難しいイメージがあります。
	どなたでも簡便に使える『ハナノアシャワー』の特徴をわかりやすく伝えたいという意図で制作しました。
	（小林製薬・広報）
	まだ馴染みがあまりなく、使うのが難しそうな鼻うがいのメリットをわかりやすく伝えるため、このようなビジュアルを採用したそう。
	インパクトある広告は、確信犯だったということですね。
	その効果は、先述したＳＮＳの反応をみても大きかったと言えるでしょう。

	１月３１日に発表された２０１６年４～１２月期決算は、売上高が前年同期比２６％減の３１１１億円、営業利益は同３８％減の２６３億円と減収減益だった。
	昨年に発売した『ポケットモンスターサン・ムーン』が牽引して携帯ゲーム機関連は伸びたが、据え置き型ゲーム機「ＷｉｉＵ」の販売減少が響いた。
	また、好採算のゲームソフトのダウンロード販売比率の低下や期末にかけ広告費を積み増すことを加味し、通期の営業益予想を３００億円から２００億円へ下方修正した。

	ビーナスベルト（ＢｅｌｔｏｆＶｅｎｕｓ）とは
	「ビーナスベルト」とは、日の出や日没時に見られる大気現象です。
	太陽と反対側の空に見られるピンク色の帯のことで、その下に見える藍色「地球影」あるいは「ダークセグメント（暗帯）」もセットで扱うことが多いようです。
	よく見られるのはアッシュピンクですが、場合によってはオレンジだったり多少の色幅が見られます。

	まぁ解らないときは手を動かすに限ると言うことで、佐藤さんの原図を自分なりになぞってみたら．．．理解出来ました！（・∀・）
	自分（＝観察者）が立ってるところはかろうじて夜側（地球の影の中）ですね。
	まさに大気のスクリーンに投影された地球の影を見てることになります。
	これなら屈折も関係ありません。

	ビーナスベルト解説図
	ビーナスベルトのしくみ
	【追記：２０１５／１２／０９】判りにくいという声があるので図を書き足してみました。
	間違ってたら教えて下さい。
	観察できるのは日の出直前・日没直後
	「そしたら、観察できるのは日の出前って事になるんだけどなぁ．．．？」と思ったら、ちゃんと説明に薄明時って書いてありましたよ。
	（白目）
	実際に写真のタイムスタンプみたら夜明け１分前だったので条件に合致します。
	私が観測したのはかなり空が明るいときだったので、自分が夜側にいるという認識が全くありませんでした。
	理解が遅かったのもそのためですね。
	はい．．．すみません。
	ビーナスベルト以外でピンク色に見える空
	空がピンク色をしていても、すべてがビーナスベルトというわけではありません。
	朝焼け・夕焼け（レイリー散乱現象）
	朝焼け・夕焼けの空
	朝焼け・夕焼けによるピンク色の空【ＰＤ】
	これは普通に朝焼けや夕焼けの空。
	一方ビーナスベルトは太陽と反対側に出現します。
	空気全体が染まってるような空（ミー散乱？）
	ピンクに染まる空
	夕立が来そうなときに見られるＲＰＧのエフェクトっぽいピンク空
	また、ビーナスベルトはその名の通り帯状に色が付きます。
	こういう「ＲＰＧで中ボス出てきそうなパターン」は含みません。
	これは「空気中の水分が多すぎて一部ミー散乱している状態」ということになるのかなぁ。
	夕立起こりそうなときによく見る気がします。
	誰か教えてえらい人。

	まずタンギングですが、バリトンの場合、クラシック的なきれいな発音を意識しすぎると低音域の輪郭がぼやけがちになります。
	従って、自分で「少しアタックが強すぎるかな？」と思うくらいのタンギングをしたほうが良いでしょう。
	ただ、むやみやたらに強くすると逆効果ですので、練習が必要です。

	あとバリトンの場合、マウスピースも違ってきます。
	アルト等で使われるセルマーＣ＊だと狭すぎます。
	クラシックの場合でもセルマーだったらＤ～Ｅ。
	Ｓ９０でしたら１２０。
	ヤナギサワ等ならば７番くらいのモノをお薦めします。
	もっともこれは演奏者の体格、体力次第ですので、必要以上に番号の大きなモノを使っても意味がありません。
	それでも、ある程度のティップ・オープニング（くわえるところの広さ）があるとバリトンの場合劇的に楽になる場合があります。
	色々試してみて下さい。

	低音域は得てして「もやもや」としてしまうか、爆発音となってしまうか、とにもかくにもバリトンの最大の武器にして泣き所です。
	それを小さな音のタンギング練習、並びに、やはり小さな音でのロングトーンで克服しましょう。
	もう一つ高音域も泣き所です。
	こちらは、自分で思うよりも少し多めの息を入れてやると良いでしょう。
	ただし上の方の音ではアンブシュアをきつくしてしまいがちです。
	意識して少し緩める位の気持ちで（本当は下から上まで一定なのが理想的ですが）息で音を支えてあげると良いでしょう。
	これもロングトーンが大事です。
	倍音練習（オーバートーン）も有用です。
	これは教則本が出ているはずなので探してみて下さい。
	「サクソフォーン・ハイトーンズ」というタイトルだったと思います。

	ロングトーン練習の時は、必ずメトロノームを使用すること。
	クレッシェンド、デクレッシェンドのロングトーンは、呼吸器系のみならず、アンブシュアを形成する上でも非常に有用ですので、通常のロングトーンと平行して必ず行って下さい。
	スケール練習にはクローゼの教則本が比較的取り組みやすい気がします。
	（といっても最近売ってるのか心許ないですが・・・ヤマハ等、大型店の輸入楽譜のコーナーにありました）
	で、ここからがバリトンの練習のポイントです。
	特に練習するべきなのは、タンギングと極端な低音域と高音域のコントロールです。

	ペニシリン系抗生物質は時間依存性の抗菌薬です。
	また、ＰＡＥが短い（血中濃度が低くなると細菌は増殖を開始する）という性質のため、常にＭＩＣよりも高い血中濃度を維持しなければいけません。
	ただ、ペニシリン系抗生物質の多くは半減期が１時間程度です。
	そのため、１日に何回も投与しなければいけません。
	通常は４～６時間おきの投与が必要だとされています。
	適切な血中濃度を維持することで、薬の効果を最大限に得ることができ、さらには耐性菌の出現を防ぐことができます。

	ペニシリンＧが作用するのはグラム陽性球菌です。
	グラム陽性球菌としては、黄色ブドウ球菌や化膿レンサ球菌、肺炎球菌が知られています。
	ただし、黄色ブドウ球菌はβ－ラクタマーゼを作るようになったため、使用することはできません。
	肺炎球菌についても、同じように多くの耐性菌が確認されています。
	基本的にはグラム陽性球菌に活用しますが、グラム陰性球菌の中でも淋菌や髄膜炎菌に対してペニシリンＧは有効です。
	ただし、淋菌はペニシリンＧへの耐性化が進んでいることから、使用できないことも多いです。
	なお、ペニシリンＧが第一適応となるケースがあります。
	それは、梅毒を治療するときです。
	梅毒スピロヘータを治療するとき、他の抗菌薬よりもペニシリンＧが効果的なのです。
	抗生物質として最も古典的なペニシリンＧですが、化膿レンサ球菌や肺炎球菌、髄膜炎菌、梅毒スピロヘータに対して現在でも活用することがあるのです。

	基本的に、抗菌薬の開発が進むことでペニシリンの構造から離れていくと、グラム陽性菌への作用が弱まり、グラム陰性菌への作用が強まると考えてください。
	アミノペニシリンは古典的ペニシリンの次に開発されたペニシリン系抗生物質であり、化膿レンサ球菌や肺炎球菌への働きは弱くなっています。
	その代わり、グラム陰性桿菌の腸内細菌をカバーしています。
	例外として、アミノペニシリンではグラム陽性球菌の中でも腸球菌に対しては効果が強くなっています。
	これらアミノペニシリンとしては、アンピシリン・スルバクタム（商品名：ユナシン）、アモキシシリン（商品名：サワシリン）、アモキシシリン・クランブラン酸（商品名：オーグメンチン、クラバモックス）があります。
	スルバクタムとクランブラン酸はβ－ラクタマーゼ阻害薬であり、アミノペニシリンが分解されなくすることで抗生物質の効果を高めます。

	あらゆる細菌の中でも、緑膿菌は抗菌薬が効きにくい細菌として知られています。
	そこで、グラム陽性菌やグラム陰性菌、嫌気性菌に加え、緑膿菌への作用を示すペニシリン系抗生物質として抗緑膿菌ペニシリンが開発されています。
	抗緑膿菌ペニシリンとしては、ピペラシリン（商品名：ペントシリン）、ピペラシリン・タゾバクタム（商品名：ゾシン）が知られています。
	タゾバクタムはβ－ラクタマーゼ阻害薬です
	なお、あらゆる細菌に効果を示すわけではありません。
	例えば、ＭＲＳＡに対して抗緑膿菌ペニシリンは効果がありません。

	一次構造の決定
	１．いくつのペプチドでできているか。
	２．ジスルフィド結合の有無。
	３．ペプチドを小さくする。
	大きなポリペプチドは適当な大きさに分解して分析する。
	例、トリプシンＬｙｓとＡｒｇのカルボキシル基を切断する。
	キモトリプシンＰｈｅとＴｒｐとＴｙｒのカルボキシル基を切断する。
	例Ａｓｐ－Ｍｅｔ－Ｌｅｕ－Ｐｈｅ－Ｍｅｔ－Ａｒｇ－Ａｌａ－Ｔｙｒ－Ｇｌｙ－Ａｓｎ
	このペプチドをキモトリプシンで分解すると、
	「Ａｓｐ－Ｍｅｔ－Ｌｅｕ－Ｐｈｅ」「Ｍｅｔ－Ａｒｇ－Ａｌａ－Ｔｙｒ」「Ｇｌｙ－Ａｓｎ」ができる。
	ちなみに、このペプチドのｐＩ値は６．１である。
	「ｐＨ、アミノ酸」のページのアミノ酸の表とペプチド中でのｐＫ値の表を見比べてがんばって計算してほしい。
	タンパク質
	・タンパク質の構造
	一次構造
	一次構造とはペプチド中のアミノ酸がどのように並んでいるかである。
	二次構造
	二次構造ではペプチドがどのような立体構造をとるかであり、α－ヘリックス（らせん構造）やβ－シート（直鎖構造）などがある。
	三次構造
	ポリペプチド全体の三次元構造でα－ヘリックス、β－シートなどがどのように組み合わさるかにより決定する。
	多くのタンパク質ではα－ヘリックスやβ－シート構造がはっきりわかる超二次構造を形成している。
	超二次構造とはタンパク質の中のアミノ酸配列とは関係なく共通に見られる特定の二次構造単位の組み合わせである。
	下に超二次構造のモチーフを示す。
	四次構造
	二本以上のペプチド鎖がくっついたたんぱく質は四次構造をもつ。
	タンパク質の四次構造を形成しているペプチドの単位をプロトマーまたはサブユニットという
	ちなみに、ヘモグロビンはポリペプチドが４個あつまってはじめて機能するので四次構造をとっている。
	フォールディング
	タンパク質を形成するにあたり、二次構造をもつペプチド（α－ヘリックスやβ－シート）が形成される。
	このペプチド片が方向づけられ、合成されたタンパク質が機能を果たすことのできるドメインに育っていく。
	この過程をフォールディングという。
	また、タンパク質のフォールディングを正しく行われるように制御するタンパク質にタンパク質ジスルフィドイソメラーゼ、プロリルシストランスイソメラーゼ、分子シャペロンがある。
	・タンパク質ジスルフィドイソメラーゼ
	ジスルフィド結合の組み換えを促進して、Ｓ－Ｓ結合の再編成をする。
	・プロリルシストランスイソメラーゼ
	ペプチドの合成直後はトランス配置をもつが、１０％ぐらいは立体障害の大きいシス配置をとってしまう。
	そのため変換反応を行う。
	立体障害の緩和
	・分子シャペロン
	シャペロニンはほどけたポリペプチド鎖に結合し、誤った会合（結合）や立体配置を形成しないようにしている。

	方法２：「思いこみ」の範囲を限定する
	日常生活のささいな思いこみが、普遍的な法則だったなんてことはありません。
	かならずそこには「範囲」があるのです。
	思い込みの適応範囲を一部に限定していきましょう。
	時間、場所、状態、人、環境などあらゆる側面から限定していくのです。
	「小学校の時はバカだったかもしれないが、社会人となり家庭を築いている私はもうバカではない」
	これも紙やパソコンにどんどん書いていき、読み上げましょう。
	「昔＋あの場所＋あの時の自分＋特定の人」という条件でたまたま感じたことを、真実のように信じこむのはおかしいことに気がつくでしょう。

	「私はどうしてこれに悩んでいるのだろうか？」
	※「自分を悩ませている思いこみ」にたどり着くまで、これをトコトン掘りさげていきます。

	心の整理がスピーディになる

	今日はあなたの抱えている心の悩みが、大幅に軽減できる５つの方法を紹介します。
	どうして「悩み」はおきるのか？犯人は「思いこみ」
	最新鋭の研究結果や、何千年も前から伝承によって、すでに悩みの正体は明らかになっています。
	悩みがおきる原因は、脳のなかにねむっている「思いこみ」にあります。
	気がついていない「思いこみ」があなたを欺き（あざむき）、悩ませるのです。
	・人前で話すのが苦手だと悩んでいる人は、「バカだと思われたくない」「私の話はつまらない」等の思いこみに苦しんでいます。
	・部長のＡさんが苦手で悩んでいる人は、「また厳しく注意される」「あのタイプの人は私のことが気に入らないのだろう」等の思い込みに苦しんでいます。
	・借金で悩んでいる人は、「お金がなくなったら最悪の結末になる」等の思いこみに苦しんでいます。
	これらの「思いこみ」を心理学ではリミッティング・ビリーフ（あなたを制限させる信念）とよんだり、仏教で煩悩（ぼんのう）とよんだりします。
	思考の「フレームワーク」や「定義付け」とも言ったりします。
	そして、古今東西の学者や賢者たちがしめす悩みの解決方法は共通なのです。
	悩みの解決のカギは、「”あなたを苦しませる思いこみ”に気づき、それを無効化すること」です。

	足もとで、日本の高齢化率（総人口のうち６５歳以上が占める割合）は２６．７％（２０１５年国勢調査）となっており、日本人の４人に１人以上は高齢者です。
	現役世代と高齢世代の比率は２．５対１（２０１３年時点）で、現役世代２～３人で１人の高齢者を支える「騎馬戦」の状態になっています。
	これが、高齢化率のピークを迎えると見られる２０６０年には１．３対１となり、ほぼ１人の現役が１人の高齢者を支える「肩車」の状態になります。
	一方、日本の社会保障の給付は約１１６兆円ですが、このうち労使折半の保険料でカバーできているのは６割に過ぎず、残り４割は税金で賄われています。
	財政赤字が拡大し続ける日本は、社会保障給付を税金だけでは賄い切れず、赤字国債を増発し、借金が現役世代へツケ回されています。
	今後、少子高齢化で現役世代が減り、高齢世代が増え続ければ、社会保障の給付が増える半面、それを支える財源はどんどん先細り、日本は財政破綻の危機に直面しかねません。
	もう１つの深刻な影響は、地方自治体の消滅です。
	過疎問題は高度経済成長時代からありましたが、今後は地域によって人口減少、高齢化が極端に進み、立ちゆかなくなる自治体が増えそうです。
	２０１４年に民間の日本創成会議・人口減少問題検討分科会が発表した報告書によると、これまでと同じ人口流出が続くと想定した場合、子どもを生む若手女性人口（２０～３９歳）が２０４０年にかけて５割以下まで減少する市町村は８９６（全体の４９．８％）、このうち２０４０年時点で人口が１万人を切る市町村は５２３（同２９．１％）と見られています。
	今後２５年間で、全国市町村の約３割が消滅する可能性が高いのです。

	１月２５日、経済財政諮問会議後の記者会見で石原伸晃経済再生担当相は、こう答えた。
	同日の経済財政諮問会議で、内閣府による「中長期の経済財政に関する試算」（以下、「中長期試算」）において、２０２０年度の基礎的財政収支（プライマリーバランス）の赤字が８．３兆円に拡大することが示されたため、記者から「２０２０年度の黒字化目標の達成が難しいのではないか」との質問が出たことへの回答だった。
	「中長期試算」は、年２回改訂される。
	今回は１月２２日国会提出の２０１７年度政府予算案を踏まえて試算し直した結果が公表された。

	しかし、そうしたイメージは間違っている。
	そもそも過去の先進国の経済成長は、作業員１人１人がツルハシを持って仕事をしていた工事現場にブルドーザーやクレーンが登場したことから始まりました。
	まずメーカーが機械を発明し、それが市場に投入され、道路工事を請け負う企業がそれを購入し、工事に使用するという資本蓄積が起きる。
	そして、現場が機械を動かす技能を身につけることによってイノベーション（技術進歩）が起きる。

	●財政危機に地方の消滅、人口減少の脅威は確かだが．．．．．．。
	日本は今、かつてない人口減少時代を迎えようとしています。
	２０１２年１月に公表された国立社会保障・人口問題研究所の将来推計人口（出生中位）によると、２０１５年現在、１億２７１１万人（１５年国勢調査）いる日本の人口は、２１１０年には４２８６万人になると見られています。
	今後１００年間で、日本の人口は約３分の１まで減少するというのです。
	少子化に伴う人口減少・急速な高齢化により、日本社会に深刻な影響が起きるでしょう。

	政府が黒字化を目標として掲げている２０２０年度の基礎的財政収支は、昨年７月の試算で５．５兆円の赤字だったが、この１月の試算では８．３兆円の赤字に悪化したのだ。
	悪化の最大の要因は、税収の伸び悩みである。
	特に、２０１６年度の税収が予想を下回る見込みとなり、それが今回の試算に反映されたため、２０２０年度の税収が昨年７月試算よりも減る予測となった。
	これが、基礎的財政収支赤字拡大につながった。
	２０２０年度まであと３回しか予算編成が残されていないのに、８．３兆円も赤字が残る見通しならば、それを黒字化するのは困難ではないか、との見方が、冒頭の記者の質問にもつながっている。
	２０２０年度の財政健全化目標を取り下げてはどうか――、そんな声さえ出始めているという。
	今年の通常国会における恒例の施政方針演説で安倍晋三首相は「財政健全化目標」に一切言及しなかったこともあって、そうした憶測が広がった。

	まず定番なのが、テーラードジャケットです。
	黒のジャケットにジーンズを合わせたり、
	チノパンを合わせたりします。
	ジャケットの中に着るのもシャツにするかＶネックのカットソーにするかで、印象も変わってきますね。
	ジャケットを中心にコーディネートをアレンジしていくと、何パターンか組み合わせを
	作ることができます。
	ジャケットにシャツの組み合わせよりもっとカジュアルダウンしたいなら、ニットカー
	ディガンにシャツを組み合わせて、ブラックデニムや濃い目のジーンズを合わせます。
	靴はスニーカーでもいいのですが、キレイめを強調したいなら、レザーのショーツブーツ
	を合わせるのもオススメです。
	夏でキレカジファッションをしたいなら、ポロシャツが役に立ちます。
	襟が付いている
	だけでかなりキレイめ度がアップします。
	そのときのポロシャツは大きめサイズではなく、
	ジャストサイズで質の良いものがベストです。

	キレカジファッションの移り変わり
	ここにきて新たなファッションに注目が来たと思われていますが、実はキレカジと
	いう言葉はずいぶん前からありました。
	９０年代前半には、渋カジからキレカジへ
	のファッションが派生しています。
	このころのキレカジ定番スタイルは、金ボタン付き
	の紺ブレ（ブレザー）にストレートジーンズという組み合わせでした。
	当時のテレビ
	ドラマの影響もあって、こぞって真似する人が増えましたね。

	ストリートファッションの歴史
	街中にいる若者たちの間で流行りだすことからストリートファッションと呼びますが、流行りには歴史があります。
	まず、８０年代はアメカジが流行っていた時代です。
	ストリートファッションの流行りは映画や音楽から影響受けることが多いので、当時
	後悔された映画などを見ると流行りが良くわかります。
	トップガンのヒットにより、
	ミリタリー色を取り入れるのも流行りました。
	９０年代になると今のストリート系により近くなります。
	スケーターズファッション、ダボダボのヒップホップファッションに身に包む人が増えました。
	２０００年代になると８０年代や９０年代のファッションが復活し始め、ファッションブランド
	でも率先してストリート系のアイテムをデザインするようになりました。

	マフラーとコートは冬の必須アイテムですが、コートを着てマフラーを巻いてとなると、どうしても重苦しい雰囲気になってしまいます。
	重苦しく見せない為にはマフラーとコートは同じ黒色にしない、ということも大切ですが、柄物のマフラーならなおＧＯＯＤです。
	特にこちらのコーディネートのように、マフラーを巻いた時に縦にラインができる柄の物なら細身に見える効果も期待できます。
	また、コートを前開けに着ても軽く見せる事ができます。

	個人でやってくというよりも、作曲チームや、作曲、曲提供を生業にしている会社も結構あり、そっちに所属して企業戦士ライクにガシガシ機械的に曲を作るパターンの方が多いかも。

	アーティストと作曲家・演奏家の違い
	アーティスト
	例：バンド音楽全般、シンガーソングライター。
	自分たちで自分たちの演奏する曲を作るのがこちら側。
	（アーティストという言葉は厳密ではないが他にいい感じの言葉がない）
	こちら側の方の特徴は曲を作る自分たち自身が有名になるし人前に立つ、つまり自分たちそのものが商品となることだ。
	よくも悪くも芸能人的というか有名人的というか。
	ちなみに聞くところによると”アーティスト”として作詞作曲しているとクレジットされていてもなんだかんだゴーストライターが書いてることも少なくない。
	ホラ、メジャーに行ったら急に音楽性が変わったバンドとか幾つか心当たりがあるでしょう。
	メジャーレーベルにはそこそこ数お抱えの編曲家や作曲チーム等がいて、そこいらからテコ入れがあったりする。
	エイベックスに行ったミュージシャンのメジャー一発目が急にエイベックス臭撒き散らすのとか典型だろう。
	音楽で飯を食う！そう言って一握の成功者になったとしても、その先で自由に音楽をやれるかどうか、それはまた別の話だ。
	アーティスト、特に商品化されたメジャーアーティストという人種はみなさんの想像するカリスマとはちょっと違った実態をしている。
	カリスマは、商品価値の一部。
	コンビニの飯の合成添加物みたいなものだ。

	違い、おわかりいただけただろうか
	どうでしょう。
	おわかりいただけたでしょうか。
	そうです、違い、ほぼございません。
	しかし人生とは自己満足の追求にあると僕は考えております。
	こうやってツラツラ「マジでやめとけ」の言い換えを並べてきたけれども、自分がどこまで行けるをかをシビアに試し、一瞬の輝きに生のすべてをつぎ込むその姿にいまだにちょっと惹かれ憧れたりもします。
	その一瞬の輝きがあれば人間生きていた意味があったなと思えるのかもしれない。
	ステージの上のバンドは、本当に何物にも代えがたいカッコよさだし、名曲には価値のつけようもない。
	ただ、内情はみなさんの見ている表層とはだいぶ違ったりするよ。
	今回の記事はこれさえわかってくれれば大満足だ。

	ドイツオペラの重い声の役では、ヘルデンテノールと呼んだりする。
	バリトン
	「ザ・男です」的な声種のように思う。
	野暮ったさや平凡さから、強さや男らしさを表現するのに適しているだろう。

	カウンターテナー（含ソプラニスタ）
	裏声をうまく活用し駆使した、男性が出す女声のこと。
	声量はやや劣るが、神々しくデリケートな声で、時に女声よりも艶やか。
	カウンターテノール、コントラテノーレ、男声アルトや男声ソプラノともいう。
	テノールの一種とも捉えられるが、発声法は大きく異なる。
	基本的に声域はアルトとほぼ同じで、
	人によってはメゾソプラノやソプラノの声域を得意とする。
	ソプラノのカウンターテナーのことをソプラニスタと呼んだりするが、
	岡本知高氏のごとく、声変わりを経ずにソプラノ声のままの人も稀に存在する。
	この場合、後述のカストラート同様、男性としての声量によるソプラノを聴くことができる。
	また、アルトより低く、
	テノールの声域を担うフランスのカウンターテナーをオートコントルと呼ぶこともある。
	これは、極度に高いテノールとも捉えることができる。
	カウンターテナーは、
	基本的にルネサンスやバロックの音楽で活躍するが、
	現代ではオペラでメゾソプラノの役を担ったりすることも多くなっている。
	カストラート
	男性を去勢し、男性ホルモンの分泌を不可能にすることで、
	声変わり前の高い声を人為的に保った声種。
	成長ホルモンは分泌され続けるため、身体だけは大きくなるが、
	声はソプラノのままの声であり、力強く、野生的で官能的なソプラノ声
	を持つようだ。
	１７～１８世紀のヨーロッパで最盛期を迎えたが、
	１９世紀半ばにローマ教皇によって、人道的・倫理的な理由で禁止にされた。
	史上最後のカストラート歌手は、アレッサンドロ・モレスキ氏で。
	世に録音が残っているので、興味があったら是非聴いてみてほしい。
	カウンターテナーの寄せ集めＣＤ『ＡＬＴＵＳ奇跡の声』に、
	一曲だけモレスキ氏の貴重な歌声が収録されている。

	●コロラトゥーラソプラノ
	コロコロと転がったり跳躍する旋律を専門とするソプラノ。
	同じ人間の声帯とは思えぬほど、超技巧的。
	曲例としては、モーツァルトの「夜の女王のアリア」（『魔笛』）がある。
	●ソプラノ・レッジェーロ
	軽やかで可憐な声。
	かわいらしく、愛おしい。
	高音や技巧的節回しが得意。
	個人的には、バロック声楽家のＥｍｍａＫｉｒｋｂｙがこの部類だと思う。
	●ソプラノ・リリコ・レッジェーロ
	レッジェーロよりは幾分落ち着いた、甘くて優美な声。
	高音域のみならず中音域もいける。
	●ソプラノ・リリコ
	最も一般的なソプラノと思われる。
	リリコという文字通り、叙情的な声。
	高い声が出せるが、中音域も充実。
	●ソプラノ・リリコ・スピント
	リリコより深く、太めの声。
	重量感があり、力強い印象。
	●ソプラノ・ドラマティコ
	ドラマチックな表現が得意なソプラノで、
	高音はもちろん、低音までをカバーし、太くエネルギッシュな声。
	真っ先に思い浮かぶは、ＪｅｓｓｙｅＮｏｒｍａｎ。
	メゾソプラノ
	大人びた女性らしさ、艶やかさや色気、
	そして包容力や母性を醸し出す上で適している声種だろう。
	オペラなどでは、少年役や魔女役を担当することもある。

	英語は配点が高いから重要。
	これが受験生の理解ですが実際にはもう少し深い要素があります。
	それは英語が唯一の「真の積み重ね型の教科」ということです。
	地歴公民は中学校でも習いますが、高校では初めからもう一度習います。
	例えば日本史なら高校で改めて縄文時代から学び直します。
	理科も同様です。
	国語は中学のときに苦手科目であっても、高校から力を入れれば伸びてきます（漢検３級程度の基礎は必要）。
	数学は積み重ねの要素が多少ありますが、英語ほどではなく挽回が可能です。
	？一方英語は中３や高１で苦手教科だった場合には、浪人して人並み勉強をしても苦手が改善されない科目です。
	人の３倍程度勉強時間をとってもなお変化はありません。
	「真の積み重ね型の教科」である英語は、基礎が不十分な場合、スタート時の偏差値が５０ならずっと５０のまま、４５ならずっと４５のまま終わることが多い、逆転が難しい科目です。

	※中高一貫校受験の方．．．自分の意志で行う受験経験がなく、勉強法や学習量に不安を持つ人が多いですが、逆に講師に相談して勉強を進める傾向があり、経験がないことが有利に働くケースがよくあります。
	欠点は英語の基礎を作る中３から高１の間で受験の壁を乗り越えていないこと。
	英語が伸び悩む傾向があります。
	※塾通いをせず高校受験をされた方．．．勉強法を確立している人が多く、塾や教材任せにする傾向がないため、大学受験で伸びるケースが良くあります。
	ただし予備校や塾の講師に勉強法を相談することは必要です。

	関西の場合．．．京産桃山→関関立→同志社
	国立の場合．．．地方国立→都市近郊の国立→旧帝大
	しかし、２番手（ＭＡＲＣＨ等）と最上位（早慶等）の間には勉強量で乗り越えられない壁があることも事実です。
	？早慶、旧帝大、同志社大などの最上位に合格する生徒には以下のような特徴があります。
	・小中学校では、理解できない授業がほとんどなく自然体で上位にいた。
	・苦手科目はあるが、総じて勉強が好き。
	または特に苦にならない。
	・受験勉強を通じて新たな発見があり興味がわくことがよくある。
	・参考書の暗記事項を隠して覚える、チェックペンで覚えるといった受け身の勉強法をほとんど用いず、自分なりの勉強法を見つけつつある。
	・計算（理系）または活字を読むこと（文系）に苦手意識はほとんどない。
	・何も考えずに過ごすことが苦手で、常に考えごとをしてしまう。
	・適度にざわざわした環境よりも、まったくの無音空間のほうが勉強がはかどる。
	？全ての受験生に最上位に合格する可能性があることは否定しませんが、高校や予備校の少なくとも５年以上指導経験がある先生に相談してみることも大切です。
	ただし最上位（早慶等）を狙う生徒が２番手（ＭＡＲＣＨ等）で止まるケースが大半ですので、ひとつ上を本気で目指すことは重要です。
	この項でお話したのは、無謀な受験計画を立てないようにという意味です。

	？【１】夜２２時ごろで勉強を打ち切ること
	後がない浪人生は不安からつい深夜まで勉強をしてしまいます。
	しかし２２時以降は人体の体内時計（時計遺伝子）が作動してリラックスモード（＝副交感神経優位）に自動的に入ります。
	この時間に机に向かっていると、脳は覚醒物質を出して作業を継続させようとします。
	わかりやすくいえばカフェイン入りのドリンク剤を飲みながら勉強をしているのに近い状況です。
	これは「偽の集中力」ということができ、実際の学力は伸びてこないことが多くなります。
	どんなに絶好調だと感じても必ず２２時には勉強を打ち切って、２３時の就寝を目指すことがカギになります。
	２３時に就寝すると６時頃に目が覚めやすくなります。
	なお休日の「寝だめ」は効果がないばかりか大きく調子を崩すことにつながります。
	少しゆっくりしたくても、＋２時間の睡眠（６時に起きる習慣がある人は、８時）が限度となります。

	報告書内容の注意点
	１．内容に欠落がないか
	報告書においては、内容に欠落があっては、役に立ちません。
	まず、数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）、固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）、単位（千、万、円、ドル、グラム、Ｋｇ等）、相手の意志（反対する、賛成する、購入する、購入しない等）を報告書から漏らしてはいけません。
	読み手に「悟ってもらう」事はありえません。
	ビジネス文書では相手は、自分の文章を「最も批判的に読む」と考えるべきです。
	自分に都合良く、相手が解釈してくれることは絶対にありえません。
	報告書を書き上げたら、妥当かどうかを確認してください。
	２．内容に誤認がないか
	・数字（金額、日時、時期、数量等）
	・固有名詞（商品名、場所、名前等）
	・単位（千、万、円、ドル等）
	・相手の意志（反対、賛成、購入する、購入しない等）
	を勝手に解釈して、事実誤認しないこと。
	誤認によって、今後の動きが違ってくる可能性があるので、事実を正確に把握することはきわめて重要です。
	これを防ぐには、メモを取るときに、重要だと思う点にサインをつけておき、商談・会議の終わりに再確認するのが望ましいと思います。

	（１）ひざの前側の痛み（オスグットシュラッター）
	症状：中学生くらいの少年がスポーツをすることにより、ひざのお皿の下（脛骨粗面）に炎症が起こり、骨が出っ張ってくる。
	押すと激痛がある。
	原因：同じスポーツをしてこのようなスポーツ障害を起こす子供と起こさない子供との差は、
	Ａ．外反母趾や浮き指（指上げ足）などの異常により足裏が不安定になっている。
	Ｂ．その不安定を大腿四頭筋が補い、大腿四頭筋が疲労・緊張して固くなる。
	Ｃ．スポーツなどでさらに疲労と緊張が増し、お皿の下（脛骨粗面）を引っ張り過ぎたことが原因です。
	（２）ひざの後ろ側の痛み（反張ひざ痛）
	症状：ひざの後ろ側（裏側）が痛んだり、中高年では脂肪腫（ベーカー嚢腫）と呼ばれる、ゴルフボールを半分に切ったくらいのサイズの腫れがあるのが特徴。
	原因：ひざの裏が痛くなる人とならない人の差は、
	Ａ．外反母趾や浮き指（指上げ足）があるかないかの差である。
	Ｂ．ひざの反り過ぎ（反張ひざ）がある場合。
	Ｃ．それにより、ひざの裏が必要以上に反り過ぎた状態（過伸展）が繰り返されたことが原因です。
	（３）ひざの内側の痛み（変形性ひざ関節症）
	症状：ひざの内側が痛む症状で、女性に多く、「変形性ひざ関節症」と呼ばれている。
	少年では「スポーツ障害」・「ひざ内側関節裂隙痛」と呼ばれている。
	原因：ひざの内側が痛くなる人とならない人の差は、
	Ａ．外反母趾や浮き指（指上げ足）で重心がかかとに片寄っているため。
	Ｂ．ひざがＯ脚傾向にあるため、重心がひざの内側に集中する。
	Ｃ．これが日常生活やスポーツで、かかとからの突き上げと自分の体重とがひざの関節面で衝突を繰り返したことが原因。
	（４）ひざの外側の痛み（ひざ外側部痛）
	症状：ひざの外側が痛む症状で、歩き始めや立ち上がる時に痛む。
	又、ひざの外側からすねの外側が痛み、腓骨頭から下を強く押すとはっきりとした痛みがあるので、損傷部位をすぐ特定できる。
	原因：ひざの外側が痛くなる人とならない人の差は、
	Ａ．外反母趾・浮き指（指上げ足）・扁平足などの異常がある。
	Ｂ．Ｘ脚かＸ脚傾向にあるひざで、重心がひざの外側に集中してしまっている。
	Ｃ．日常生活やスポーツで、ひざの外側に疲労が反復され損傷したことが原因です。
	（５）ひざの中心部の痛み（ジャンパー膝）
	症状：成長期の女子に多く、ひざのお皿の下部に脂肪組織があり、膨らんで盛り上がっているのが特徴。
	この部分を指で上方に強く押すと激痛があるのですぐに分かる。
	原因：ジャンパー膝が起こる女子と起こらない女子との差は、
	Ａ．外反母趾・浮き指（指上げ足）がある。
	Ｂ．ひざがまっすぐで生理的弯曲が消失しているので、
	ひざにかかとからの過剰な衝撃が集中する。
	Ｃ．スポーツなどで、かかとからの過剰な衝撃と自分の体重とが、
	ひざの中心で繰り返されたことが原因です。
	（６）ひざの内部の痛み（半月板損傷）
	症状：スポーツをする少年に多い。
	大人では肥満傾向の中高年に見られ、一定の角度で加重すると、
	ズキンという激痛がある。
	屈伸時には異物が挟まっているかのようなロック現象があり、関節の咬み合わせが悪く弾発現象がある。
	原因：半月板損傷を起こす人と起こさない人の差は、
	Ａ．外反母趾・浮き指（指上げ足）・扁平足などにより重心がかかとに
	片寄っている。
	Ｂ．ひざが伸びきっていたりねじれていて、上下の咬み合わせが悪く
	なっている。
	Ｃ．スポーツや日常生活の中で、咬み合わせの悪い関節に、かかとからの
	過剰な衝撃波やねじれ波が繰り返されたことが原因です。
	（７）ひざのゆるみによる痛み（十字靭帯損傷）
	症状：屈伸時にポキポキ音がして痛む。
	またひざを前に引っ張ると、筒状に動く「引き出し現象」がある。
	原因：十字靭帯損傷を起こす人と起こさない人との差は、
	Ａ．外反母趾・浮き指（指上げ足）・扁平足などの異常がある。
	Ｂ．ひざを挟んで上下で相反するねじれのストレスが発生する。
	Ｃ．スポーツや日常生活の中で、足先が外方向へ必要以上に流れるような歩行を繰り返している。

	ミントの苗選びのコツは、ひょろっと長いものよりも株元から何本も芽が出ている株を選びましょう。
	また地面の近くの下葉の裏をみて斑点状に変色していないものや虫が付いていないかも確認して下さい。
	植え付け時期はハーブ苗が出回る時期に合わせ、だいたい真冬と真夏は避ければいつでも大丈夫です。
	鉢選びと植え付けのコツ
	ミントは地植えと鉢植えの両方できますが生育旺盛で根も張るため植える鉢も大きめの鉢を選ぶ必要があります。
	目安として、市販されている黒いビニールポット３号ポット（直径９ｃｍ）に植えられている苗の場合５～６号鉢（直径１８ｃｍ）くらいを選びましょう。
	植え付ける土は保湿性のあるハーブ専用培養土か肥料が配合されている野菜栽培用などの培養土を選んでください。
	ミントを植えるときに注意したいのは混植してはいけません。
	ミントは繁殖力が強いため一緒に植えてもミントだらけになってしまい他の植物を枯らしてしまいます。
	また、ミント同士でも種間交雑をしてしまうため１鉢１品種で栽培しましょう。
	水やりと肥料
	ミントは乾燥に弱いので鉢の表面が乾いたら鉢底から水が流れ出るまで水をあげて下さい。
	また肥料に関しては基本的に植え付け時に肥料入りの培養土で植え付けたのなら追肥はあまり必要ありません。
	葉色が黄色くなってきたり葉数を増やしたい場合は固形もしくは液体の肥料を肥料の容器に書かれている用法容量に従って与えて下さい。

	『心配事の９割は起こらない』なんて本が話題になりましたが、実際アメリカで行われた研究の結果、「心配したことの“８５％”は、結局“いい結果”か“良くも悪くもない中立の結果”に終わる」んだとか。
	また、実際に心配事が現実になってしまった場合でも、約８割の人が「自分が想像していたよりも上手く出来事に対処できた！」と語っているそうです。
	「不安はそもそも現実にならないし、もしそうなっても何とかなる！」と科学的に証明されているのはなんだか心強いですね。
	心が押しつぶされてしまいそうな時は、ぜひこの結果を思い出してみて。

	≪パソコンからのメールを拒否≫
	発信元がパソコンのメール（携帯ではないメール）を、すべて受信拒否にします。
	ほぼすべての迷惑メールはパソコンから送信されているため、強力な迷惑メール対策になりますが、同時に迷惑メールではないパソコン経由のメールも届かなくなってしまいます。
	≪指定アドレス（ｏｒドメイン）受信≫
	こちらが指定したメールアドレス（ｏｒドメイン）は、必ず受信されます。
	≪指定アドレス（ｏｒドメイン）拒否≫
	こちらが指定したメールアドレス（ｏｒドメイン）は、必ず拒否されます。
	≪なりすまし拒否≫
	送信元と送信アドレスがちがう（携帯アドレスに見せかけてパソコンから送信するなど）メールは拒否します。
	上記４種類の設定を組み合わせることで、迷惑メールがｉＰｈｏｎｅに届く前にサーバで処理します。

	上述した通り、おすすめは単一選択型（ＳＡ）です。
	単一選択型の場合、回答者は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	答えやすくなる理由は、「すでに用意された選択肢のなかから、どれかひとつを選ぶだけで済む」ためです。
	自由回答型（ＦＡ）の項目の場合、回答者はゼロから記載する内容を考えざるを得なくなるので、圧倒的に回答ハードルは高くなります。

	設問の流れとしては、消費者が商品を知ったきっかけ～購入にいたるプロセス、購入後の満足度、今後の継続意向という順に聞くことが一般的です。
	回答者が思い起こしやすいよう、時系列をあわせる。
	また満足度については、先に総合満足度を聞き、その後に詳細満足度を聞くことがセオリーです。
	掘り下げていくような設問設計をする場合は、まずは総合的・一般的な質問をし、その後に詳細を聞くようにしましょう。
	※詳細満足度を先に聞くと、その内容が回答者の頭に入り総合満足度の結果が変わってしまう（バイアスがかかる）ことにつながります。

	３答えやすい質問・内容になればなるほど、回答率は上がる
	答えやすいアンケートを作成するために、「ターゲット」に合わせた口調で調査票の文章を設計しましょう。
	ポイントは、「わかりやすい文章」「ターゲット」「専門用語」「対象」「時期」「回答形式（単一選択型）」です。
	「わかりやすい文章」で質問文を書く
	意識的に、一文の長さを短めに設計すると端的でわかりやすくなります。
	また、「ターゲット」が取引先のお客様であれば、その業界に特有の「専門用語」などは通じますが、一般消費者がターゲットの場合は平易な日本語に置き換える、など工夫も必要です。
	「対象（誰、どこ、何についての質問なのか）」について明確にする
	「時期（過去・現在・未来）」を明確にする
	「回答形式」は「単一選択型」がおすすめ
	単一選択型の回答形式は、回答する側は答えやすくなり、集計する際にも便利で一挙両得です。
	回答形式については、詳細を後述します。

	アンケートには、「紙で行う場合」と「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行う場合」がありますが、弊社では、回答者がネット環境に接続できない理由がある（たとえばターゲットが高齢者のみの場合など）といった特殊なケース以外では、「インターネットのＷｅｂフォームを使って行うアンケート」をおすすめしています。
	アンケートの作成・データ収集・集計など、アンケート業務のほとんどのプロセスにおいて、業務を効率化できコストダウンも図れるためです。
	たとえば、弊社のクラウドサービスＳｙｎｅｒｇｙ！３６０の場合、回答内容によって異なる設問（ページ）へフォームを分岐できるので、Ｗｅｂフォームを活用すれば回答者の負担軽減も可能になり、回答率の向上が図れます。
	「問１にＡと回答した人は問３のページへ飛ぶ、Ｂと回答した人は問５のページへ飛ぶ」のような「設問の条件分岐」の設定が簡単に実現できます。

	回答選択肢は対象者が選択しやすいように工夫し、「その他」を選択する人が少ないようにする必要があります。
	単一選択型だけでなく、選択肢型の選択肢を設計する際、回答できる選択肢が「もれなく」「ダブりなく」用意できるよう熟考しましょう。
	選択肢型設問で必須選択の場合、回答できる選択肢が網羅されているか
	→＜対策＞「その他＋フリーアンサー」や「特になし」「あてはまるものはない」など排他の択肢を入れておく。
	「その他」には企業側が思い付かなかった顧客の声が隠されていることがあるので、その内容を把握できるようフリーアンサーボックスを付けておくと良い。
	専門用語や一般的ではない業界用語・省略語などわかりにくい用語やあいまいな表現はないか
	→＜対策＞人によって理解が異なりそうな用語は、定義付けしておく
	設問に対する選択肢になっているか
	選択肢が漏れなく重複なく（ＭＥＣＥ）設計できているか
	回答が偏らないかなど

	実はブラックとネイビー無地は悪い意味でシンプルになりがちです。
	スーツスタイルのコーディネート配色のポイントの１つがコントラストをつけすぎないことです。
	グレーに比べブラックやネイビーはコーディネートでよく使われる白シャツとのコントラストが強まり、フォーマル寄りのイメージが強まります。
	するとシンプルなイメージが強まり、毎回同じコーディネートに見られたり地味な印象を受けられやすくなります。
	そのため就活生っぽく見えてしまったり、素材の良し悪しの影響やコーディネートが似た印象になり、いまいちパッとしないイメージになりがちです。
	抽象的ですがビジネスシーンではフォーマルすぎないバランスが大事になってきます。
	そのフォーマルすぎないバランスを取れる色がグレー系と柄ありのネイビーになるのです。
	白シャツと合わせてもコントラストが低いので、良い意味で自然にぼやけてくれてネクタイの合わせやすさや優しい印象に繋がります。
	コーディネートのしやすさと地味すぎない適度な華やかさを考慮すると上の３種類に定まってきます。
	生地は基本的にウール１００％で探すのをオススメします。

	無地
	そのままの意味で柄無しの無地です。
	最もフォーマルで何も影響しないためコーディネートも組み立てやすいです。
	ただしシンプルなだけに選ぶ際は色々と注意も必要です。
	まず無地だと生地自体がごまかしがきかないため、生地の良し悪しがダイレクトに伝わってきます。
	これはファッションに興味のない人でもすぐにわかります。
	できればウール１００％かそれに近いウール混率を選ぶとツヤ感や風合いにチープ感がなくなり全体の印象もぐっとレベルアップします。
	普通に着こなしているつもりなのになぜか就活生っぽく感じてしまうのもこのことが原因です。
	ではウール１００％であれば問題ないのかと言われると必ずしもそうとは言えません。
	詳しくは後述しますが、働くためにスーツを着ているのですから、ビジネスシーンににおいてはスーツ自体の強度も重要になる人も多いはず。
	そのためにはポリエステル混の方が生地自体の強さという点では優れているのです。
	無地を選ぶ際は、必ずという訳ではないですが出来れば、生地自体の見た目とポリエステルの混率にも注意してみるのがお勧めです。
	ストライプ
	スーツ以外でも非常に多く使われる、上から下へ直線が等間隔で並んでいる柄です。
	ピッチ（間隔）によって印象が変わります。
	ピッチが太いと華やかで主張のある貫禄ある印象に、細いとシャープにフォーマル寄りになります。

	スーツの素材は基本的にはウールとポリエステルの２種類になるので、この２種類の特徴を知ることから始めましょう。
	ウール
	ウールとは動物性繊維の１種で、羊毛のことです。
	メリットの多様性からスーツを始め、ニットやコートなど幅広く使用されていてなくてはならない素材です。
	ウールのメリット
	・空気を含むため冬は暖かく夏は涼しい（ほぼオールシーズン対応）
	・伸縮性弾力性に優れ復元効果がある（型崩れしにくくシワになってもすぐ直る）
	・吸湿発散性がある（ムレずに快適）
	・肌触り着心地が良い
	・燃えにくい
	このようにウールはスーパー高機能素材なのです。
	ウールのデメリット
	・虫食いが起きる
	・洗うと縮む
	・経年劣化しやすい
	・水分があると摩擦で毛玉ができやすい
	一方、このように素材自体は動物性なのでデリケートで手入れが必要です。
	連続着用せずに休ませることや、埃や汚れを取るブラッシングが必要になってきます。
	ポリエステル
	化学繊維の一種で最も大量に生産されています。
	ポリエステルを始めとする化学繊維最大の特徴が混紡です。
	混紡とは化学繊維と天然繊維を混ぜ合わせることで互いの長所を併せ持つことができるのです。
	ポリエステルのメリット
	・繊維の中で最も頑丈、丈夫
	・シワになりにくい
	・乾きやすい
	・日光に強い
	ポリエステルのデメリット
	・吸湿性が低い
	・静電気を帯びやすい
	・チープな光沢
	このような特徴がポリエステルにはあり、ウールと混紡することでほぼお互いのデメリットをなくす補完関係になっています。
	なので、ウールとポリエステルが混紡された生地がスーツには多いのです。

	ブラック
	スーツにおいて最もフォーマルで最も着こなしが難しいのがブラックです。
	ブラックスーツは着用されるシーンによってトーンの変化があります。
	例えば、冠婚葬祭の中でも慎み深さが必要なお葬式に適しているブラックとビジネス用として使われるブラックとは色の濃さで分かれています。
	その着こなしは次回以降で紹介予定ですが、お葬式では真っ黒の生地が適していてビジネスシーンでは少しグレーがかった薄めのブラックが定番となっています。
	このようにひとつの色でもトーンを変えることで印象の違いが出てきます。
	グレー
	海外でのビジネスシーンにおけるスタンドカラーがグレーです。
	ブラックよりも柔らかく、後述するネイビーより大人っぽく落ち着いた印象になるので使い勝手は抜群です。
	グレーはトーンの違いによって３種類に分けられます。
	最もトーンの高いグレーがライトグレー、暗いグレーがチャコールグレー、その真ん中がミディアムグレーになります。
	印象の変化としては明るいほど華やかで清潔感のある印象に、暗いほど誠実さやフォーマル感の増す印象になります。
	これはほぼすべての色に当てはまる特徴です。
	ネイビー
	ネイビーもスーツではスタンダードな色になります。
	ブラック、グレーより若々しく爽やかな印象になるのでどの年代の方にもお勧めできる色です。
	ネイビーも名称はそれぞれですが、ダークネイビー、ネイビー、ブルーなどトーンによって印象に変化があります。
	日本人にとって最も肌馴染みが良くしっくり感じやすいのがネイビー系になるので、自然に所有しているスーツで一番多い色になりがちです。
	ビジネスシーンの一般的なスーツの色はこのブラック、グレー系、ネイビー系になります。
	ただし、必ずしも世間のイメージと着こなしが一致するとは限りません。
	詳しくは後述しますが、この中から整って見えやすい＝おしゃれな印象を与えやすいものを選ぶことが必要です。
	また仕事によっては明るめのグレーやブルーには注意が必要です。
	日本のビジネスシーンでは落ち着きや信頼感が重視されるので、できれば抑えめのトーンで選んであげるといいでしょう。

	ピンストライプ
	小さな点が連なってストライプを構成しているものです。
	ピンを打ち込んだように見えるのでピンストライプと言います。
	ストライプ自体は目立ちにくいのですが、その分コーディネートしやすくビジネスシーンでも使いやすいです。
	・ストライプの細さは細め、薄め。
	ペンシルストライプ
	抽象的になってしまいますが鉛筆で書いたような細さのストライプです。
	ストライプ自体はくっきりとしていて遠目から見てもはっきりと分かります。
	・ストライプの細さはやや細め、はっきり見える。
	チョークストライプ
	チョークで線を引いたように太めで掠れたようなストライプです。
	おしゃれな雰囲気は出やすいのですが、主にピッチが太く秋冬の起毛感のある生地によく使われるためベーシックな着こなしではオススメはできないです。
	・ストライプの細さは太め、ピッチが広いため目立ちやすい。
	チェック
	ストライプに比べ、柄が大ぶりで目立ちやすいためカジュアル寄りになります。
	基本的な着こなしがテーマのここではオススメはしないですが、柔らかく優しい印象になるため、今後詳しく紹介します。
	ウィンドウペン
	窓の格子のような四角形が特徴のチェックです。
	主に大ぶりな柄で現在のトレンドとも合間って非常におしゃれな印象にはなりますが、着こなしは若干難しくなります。
	そして目立ちます。
	グレンチェック
	千鳥格子など非常に細かなチェックを重ねて大きなチェックにしたものです。
	複雑な柄になっており、その分おしゃれな印象になりやすいです。
	カジュアルでも秋冬のストール、マフラーなどによく使われています。
	織り柄
	織り柄とは生地を織る段階で糸の向きを工夫して柄を浮き立たせたものです。
	そのほとんどが遠目では無地のように見え、近づいたり光の加減で柄が浮き出るように見えます。
	非常にさりげない柄になるので無地のように使え、無地ほど地味ではないのでオススメです。
	シャドーストライプ
	織り柄で表現されたストライプのことでピッチや線の太さは生地によってまちまちです。
	光の当たり具合で浮き出て見えるため、柄自体が主張しすぎずに程よく目立ちビジネスシーンでも全く問題なく使えます。
	またツヤ感のある生地に多く使われるため、そこも大きなポイントとなります。
	選ぶ際は太さとピッチに注意して、できるだけ細くピッチの狭いものを選ぶようにするとより着こなしやすさや印象アップに繋がりやすくなります。
	シャドーチェック
	上述のシャドーストライプのチェックバージョン。
	目立たなくはなりますがチェックは変わらず砕けた印象になってしまうのでこちらもオススメはしにくいです。
	バーズアイ
	鳥目織りとも言われ、菱型の鳥の目のような小さな模様が無数にある柄です。
	こちらも遠目から見ると無地に見えるので着こなしやすいです。
	この非常に細かな無数にある柄が陰影を表現し、控えめながらも様々な見え方になります。
	若干渋いイメージにはなるのですが、ネイビーなどではかなりオススメの柄になります。

	感染症による身体のだるさは一時的なものであり、病気の軽快とともに自然に治まりますが、もししばらく続くようなら倦怠感以外の症状をチェックしてみてください。
	体重の減りや息切れ、発汗、発熱、不眠などを伴う場合は、大きな病気が隠れている恐れがありますので、早めに医師に相談しましょう。

	他にも、顔にむくみがある場合は腎臓や心臓疾患、顔色が悪くめまいがする場合は貧血や更年期障害、低血圧症のおそれがあります。
	更年期障害の場合は、閉経の前後に女性ホルモンのバランスの変化により、だるさや疲れ、不眠などの症状が出ます。
	さらに大きな病気の前触れとして、うつ病や心身症などの精神疾患や、慢性肝炎や肝硬変などの肝臓の疾患、胃がん、大腸がん、糖尿病、結核、慢性腎盂腎炎などの症状としてだるさや倦怠感が現れることもあります。
	疲労からなりやすいと言われるうつ病は、特別な疾患はないにも関わらず、だるさが続き、気力が低下したり、落ち込むことがあります。
	だるさや倦怠感を感じた場合、まず休養を取ることが大切ですが、なかなか回復しない場合は他の病気の可能性はないかと疑うことも必要です。

	内科の病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感
	内科の病気の症状が現れる前に、疲労感が現れることもあります。
	時間が経つとそれぞれの病気が持つ特徴的な症状が現れますが、それまでの病気がまだ分かっていない間に疲労感は現れます。
	精神的なストレスの蓄積や過労、睡眠不足、心配事などが原因で、軽いうつ病の症状として疲労感を感じることがあります。
	また、自律神経障害の症状として疲労感が生じることもあります。
	また、立ち仕事やパソコン業務の長時間労働などにより肉体的な疲労感を感じることもあります。
	同じ姿勢で長時間いることで一部の筋肉しか使われず、特定の筋肉のこりを生じやすいからです。
	筋肉のこりは肩や首、頭部にかけて生じることが多いため、頭痛やめまい、目の奥が痛むなどの症状が現れることがあります。
	他にも、睡眠時無呼吸症候群や慢性疲労症候群、潜在的ビタミンＢ１欠乏症、糖尿病などの病気の前触れとして現れる疲労感もあります。
	回復しないだるさや倦怠感がある場合は、重大な病気が潜んでいることもあるので、病院で診てもらう必要があります。
	また、定期的に人間ドッグなどの健康診断を受けることも大切です。

	花粉症の改善に効果が期待できるとして注目される代表的な乳酸菌とビフィズス菌には、以下のようなものがあります。
	●フェカリス菌
	加熱殺菌して死滅した状態で摂取しても高い効果が得られる新型乳酸菌。
	スギ花粉症患者２０名に曝露（ばくろ）室で人工的に一定量の花粉を浴びてもらい、その後、フェカリス菌入り乳性飲料を１日１本２か月間飲用後にも同じ実験を実施。
	飲む前と後では、鼻かみ回数や目のかゆみなどが減り、アレルギー症状が改善する傾向が認められました。
	●Ｌ－９２乳酸菌
	花粉症にかかった人を対象に、一定期間にわたってＬ－９２乳酸菌を摂取してもらったところ、
	アレルギーの原因となる「Ｔｈ２細胞」を活性化する物質が抑えられました。
	その結果、花粉症の改善に効果があることが立証されました。
	●ＫＷ乳酸菌
	花粉症患者９６人にＫＷ乳酸菌の粉末を摂取してもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善。
	また、マウスによる実験において、血中のＩｇＥ濃度が低下し、Ｔｈ２細胞とＴｈ１細胞のバランスが改善されたことも報告されています。
	●ビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６
	スギ花粉が飛び始める約１か月前から１３週間にわたって、花粉症患者４４名にビフィズス菌ｂｂ５３６粉末を飲んでもらったところ、花粉症の症状が改善されたという実験結果が報告されています。
	以上は代表的なものですが、今後もさらに注目の新しい菌が発見される可能性もあります。

	体にウイルスなどの敵が侵入すると、白血球内のリンパ球に存在する免疫細胞が、攻撃をしかけて撃退します。
	このときに抗体を作り、再び同じ敵が侵入してきたときのために備えます。
	この抗体が「ＩｇＥ抗体」と呼ばれるもので、花粉を敵と勘違いして、花粉に接触する度に「ＩｇＥ抗体」が作られて体内に蓄積され、ある水準を超えると花粉症として発症します。
	また、免疫細胞である「Ｔｈ１細胞」と「Ｔｈ２細胞」も、花粉症を発生させる原因のひとつといわれています。
	その仕組みは、アレルギー反応を促す「Ｔｈ２細胞」と、それを見張ってアレルギー反応を抑える「Ｔｈ１細胞」のバランスが崩れることで、花粉症などのアレルギーが発症するというものです。

	会食費や、旅行代が親御様一人につき１～２万円程度がそれに加わっているようです。
	プレゼント２万円＋ご両親会食代ｏｒ旅行代２～３万円＝５万円前後あくまで目安なので、ご兄弟の人数やお祝いの方法によってご予算は変わってきますので、お祝いされる皆さんでご旅行など金額が大きくなるときは、事前に積み立てをされるのもいいですね。

	還暦のお祝いは長寿のお祝いなので、何回有っても良い、めでたい事用の蝶々結びで、赤白の水引を使います。
	のしの書き方は、上のほうに「祝還暦」「寿還暦」「還暦御祝」などが一般的ですが、なんだか形式的なので「ありがとう」っていうのもお勧めです。
	下のほうには、贈る人の名前を書きましょう。
	たまに、お父さんなどお祝の方のお名前で申し込まれる方がいらっしゃいますが、それでは逆になってしまうので注意しましょう。
	入れるお名前は、受け取った方が誰からの贈物か解れば大丈夫です。
	例えば、自分の家族からなら苗字だけ、兄弟なら名前だけという具合です。
	連名で贈られるときには３名様ぐらいのお名前がちょうどいいでしょう。
	それ以上の人数になるときは、
	「家族一同」や「兄弟一同」などと入れるといいでしょう。
	ちょっと茶目っ気を出して「あなたの愛する娘達より」なんていうのもいいですね。
	贈物というより、プレゼントって感じの方は、のしではなく、メッセージカードを付けるといいと思いますよ

	明治の頃までは年齢は数え年で表していて、生れた時が１歳で始まり、年が明けると誕生日と関係なく２歳になる数え方をしてました。
	ですので、「満年齢で６０歳の誕生日」の年が「数え年の６１歳」になります。
	ちょっと注意したいのは、その年の１月１日から１２月３１日までが、数え年の６１歳なんですね。
	満年齢が一般的な現在では違和感はありますが、年が明けたお正月には数え年で６１歳の誕生年？になるので、お正月から節分（立春）の頃までにお祝いを済ませていたようです。
	現在は満年齢が一般的になっているため、６０歳を迎える誕生日にお祝いをされるのが一般的になってきています。

	報告書の形式・分量、内容は「誰に」「何の目的で」報告書を提出するのかによって異なります。
	それぞれ目的にあった「まとめ方」が必要です。
	（１）トップ・役員へ提出する報告書
	【内容】大口の商談、大きなトラブル、重大な環境変化、重大な情報（ライバル社の重大な動向）等
	【形式・分量】Ａ４用紙１枚程度で要旨のみ（約２００字程度）
	【特徴】所見は必ずつける。
	また、すみやかに提出する
	【ポイント】
	立場が上の方は忙しいので、少ない文字数で専門用語などを極力控えて、分かり易く書きます。
	また、経営判断にかかわる内容であるので、報告書はいち早く提出する必要があります。
	所見をかならずつけ、判断の助言をします（偉い人は現場の詳細な事まで知らない事が多いので、現場担当者の意見をまず聞く事が多い）。
	自分の仕事が認められ、抜擢されるチャンスでもあるので、気合いを入れて書いてください。
	（２）上司、先輩など部署内で出す報告書
	【内容】商談、業務内容、出張、研修、トラブル、ライバル社の動向等、通常業務における報告
	【形式・分量】要旨をＡ４用紙１枚程度、詳細内容を各必要があれば、２～３枚作成
	【特徴】所見は必要に応じてつける（必要かどうか聞く）、提出は翌日が望ましい。
	遅くとも数日以内が基本
	【ポイント】
	まず、報告目的にもよるが、「簡単に書け」と言われれば、２００字以内（要旨のみで可）で書く。
	「詳細に知りたい」と言われれば、「要旨」＋「詳細内容」の構成で書きます。
	組織内の報告書を素早く作成するためには、形式・内容について、まず、「前例踏襲」すべきです。
	さもなければ、上司に形式を相談してから作成すべきです。
	何も指示がなければ、できるだけ詳細に書いた方が後で業務の役に立ちます。
	特に商談や業務報告は上司といえども、細かい部分が書かれていないと判断できないので、できるだけ詳細に書くべきです。
	（３）お客さまに出す報告書
	【内容】トラブル報告、調査報告等、会社対会社で実施する報告
	【形式・分量】要旨をＡ４用紙１枚程度、詳細内容を２～３枚作成
	【特徴】所見は不要。
	提出は報告期限までに提出する
	【ポイント】
	文書形式は２段構えです。
	要約を１枚作成し、詳細内容を別紙として作るのが基本です。
	提出先の社内での報告書利用方法を想定すると、この形式が喜ばれます。
	要約は上司などの立場が上の方へ、詳細内容は現場担当者が必要とします。
	形式、内容については、自組織向け報告書の何倍もチェックが必要です。
	内容がまずい（事実誤認、間違い）があればトラブル（最悪、訴えられる）事も考えられます。
	提出前に法務担当部署の確認を取るなどは常識です。
	自分の判断で勝手に提出しない事。
	加えて、注意を要するのが「儀礼に反しないか」の確認です。
	相手の心象が極端に悪くなります。

	始値、高値、安値、終値といった株価の動向を示す４本の値段を１本の線で表しているもののことです。
	形がローソクに似ているためこう呼ばれています。
	目先の相場展開を予想したり、相場の強弱を見るものとして使われています。
	ローソク足はチャート（値動きのグラフ）を書く場合に用いられ、相場の方向性（トレンド）を視覚的に読み取ることができます。

	例えば「良品計画の株価は３年前に比べて今は３倍になった＝高くなった」という意味です。
	２つ目は、２つの企業の株価を比較する場合です。
	実例を見てみましょう。
	良品計画の株価が２５０００円、ニトリが１００００円とします。
	この時、「良品計画はニトリより株価が高い」と言えます。

	トヨタの株価が７５００円、スズキの株価が４０００円とします。
	株価収益率はトヨタが１０倍、スズキが１７倍になっています。
	トヨタの株価はトヨタ１年分の１株純利益の１０年分、スズキは１７年分ですので、スズキのほうが投資家の人気・期待が高く割高と言えます。

	インターネットの株価欄の活用法
	インターネットサイトの利点は、今現在の株価がすぐに分かることに加えて、以下の３つがあります。
	●タイムリーな株価に基づいて、株式時価総額、株価収益率、株価純資産倍率が自動計算されている
	●タイムリーな株価に基づいてさまざまなチャートを自由に利用できる
	●銘柄に関連するニュースをすばやく知ることができる
	株式市場を俯瞰的に見るには新聞にも利点がありますが、既に気になる銘柄があって、それを追いかけるならインターネットの株価欄はお勧めです。
	ちなみに、多くのサイトでは無料で利用できるサービスだけでも株式投資で必要なほとんどの情報をカバーできます。
	より詳しい情報を知りたい方には、証券会社のインターネットサイトがおすすめです。

	株価とは、一株当たりの価格のことです。
	市場で売り手と買い手が取引のたびに合意した価格です。
	株価はその企業の現在から将来にわたる見通しを反映しています。
	その見通しは投資家の間で刻々と変化していきますので、株価もこれに連動して常に変動します。
	ここが株価の見方を難しくしているのですが、原理はリンゴ１個、ミカン１個の価格と同じです。

	株価の見方は難しいと感じることはありませんか。
	株式を始めたばかりの方だけではありません。
	投資経験を積んできた方も、時として直面する投資家共通の悩みです。
	実は株価の見方は非常に単純で、株価が割高か割安かさえ押さえれば判断を誤ることがありません。
	株価の見方で迷っている投資家の方は、いつの間にかこの基本を忘れてしまっているケースがほとんどです。
	そんな時は、今の株価が割安なのか割高なのか、なるべくシンプルに整理することが投資で成功する近道です。
	これまで見てきた成功した投資家の多くも、要所要所でこうアプローチしてきました。
	私の長年の投資経験からも同じ結論になります。
	そこで、株価を正しく見る視点、株価の意味と情報の読み取り方を身につけて、適切な投資判断につなげていきましょう。
	ざっくりいうと
	「株価の高低」と「時価総額の大小」の違いを明確に理解できるようになることが投資家への第一歩です。
	「株価の高低」と「株価の割高・割安」の違いをおさえることが、投資判断をする上でこの上なく重要です。

	・ソフトウェアのアップデートが累積している場合
	ＷｉｎｄｏｗｓＵｐｄａｔｅ、ＡｐｐＳｔｏｒｅのソフトウェアアップデート、Ａｄｏｂｅ製品のアップデート、ＪａｖａＵｐｄａｔｅのような「更新」が累積していると、インターネットに接続したときにまとめてアップデートが実行され、画面表示がまったく追いつかなくなることがあります。
	この場合も気長に待つことになります。
	また更新の際には、ハードディスクの動作ランプが激しく明滅しますので、判断のポイントになります。
	根本的な対処方法として、パソコンをこれまでよりたくさん起動する、アップデート情報に敏感になるなどの意識が必要です。
	これらのソフトはインターネットで個別に「手動アップデート」をすることもできますので、これを利用するのもよいでしょう。

	パソコンの起動が途中で止まる場合、問題がない場合とある場合があります。
	Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓパソコンで起動中に真っ暗な画面がしばらく続く場合、多くは「何も問題はない」といえます。
	パソコン本体を見ると、ハードディスクの動作を示すランプがちかちか不規則に点滅しているはずです。
	場合によっては起動ができるまで辛抱強く待ちましょう。
	ただし、毎回起動時に真っ黒画面が続くようであれば異常が考えられますので、専門家にご相談ください。
	一方で問題が発生している場合は、コンピューターはどんな異常が発生しているのかを利用者に知らせるようにできています。
	これには、画面が真っ青になって（ブルースクリーンといいます）英語で異常報告が行われる場合と、黒い画面に異常報告がおこなわれる場合があります。
	これらの異常報告画面が表示されたときには、専門家でない限り、手出しはしない方がよいでしょう。
	可能ならば異常報告画面を記録しておき、メーカーやお店のサポートいった専門家に相談しましょう。

	１．動かないときに確認すること
	パソコン動かないと思ったときに重要なことは「落ち着くこと」です。
	実際にはなかなか難しいものですが、パソコンが動かなくなったときはまず落ち着き、下記の３つの手順に従いましょう。
	動かなくなったときに確認すること
	このとき、「急いで何かをしなくてはならないことが別にある」のであれば、まずはそちらを解決しましょう。
	パソコンのトラブルは、落ち着いてじっくり取り組むことが大切です。
	パソコンでしなければならない作業があるのなら、ほかのパソコンや手作業で片付けてからにしましょう。
	１－１．パソコンでの作業中か確認
	まず確認しなくてはいけないことは、そのパソコンが作業中かどうかです。
	ワープロで書類作成中だったのでしょうか、それともインターネットを閲覧中でしたか？そういうことをまず確認しましょう。
	１－１－１．ワープロソフトなどでの入力中か確認
	ワープロソフトなどでの入力中の場合、単純に文字変換に手間取っているだけということがよくあります。
	パソコンではＩＭ（インプットメソッド、文字入力ソフト。ＷｉｎｄｏｗｓではＭＳ－ＩＭＥ、Ｍａｃでは「ことえり」が標準ＩＭ）という変換ソフトで入力された文字を漢字などに変換していきますが、使い込んでいくと学習したデータが膨大になって、変換に時間がかかることがあります。
	１－１－２．インターネットの閲覧中か確認
	インターネットを閲覧中に動かなくなった場合、先述のＩＭが遅いだけということのほかに、回線の速度が遅くて情報表示が追いつかない、あるいは時間切れになってしまうということが起きます。
	また、「ソフトウェアのアップデート」が不十分で、インターネットを使おうとした時に複数の自動アップデートが一斉に動き出して、動作が非常に遅くなることもあります。
	１－１－３．ソフトの起動をしようとしたのか確認
	ソフトを起動しようとしてパソコンが動かなくなるケースでは「ソフト自体の不具合」が疑われます。
	いわゆる「バグ」というソフトの不良や、開こうとしたファイルに問題があって、バグを誘発して止まってしまうことがあります。
	１－２．起動を終えて作業を始める前か確認
	パソコンの電源を入れてしばらくすると、最初の画面が表示されます。
	しかし多くの場合、この時点では「一見使用できる準備が整ったように見えて、実際はまだ起動処理中」の状態です。
	この場合、パソコンは「パソコン自体の起動」を優先しますから、ほかの処理は後回しになります。
	そのため、止まっているように感じることがあります。
	１－３．パソコンが起動の途中で終了するのか確認
