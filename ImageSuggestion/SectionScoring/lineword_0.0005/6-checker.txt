	走行にはゴムタイヤが使用され、Ｉ型のレールを両側から挟みこむようにゴムタイヤは配置されています。
	また、単に両側から挟みこむだけでは安定しないので、上下２段、２対のゴムタイヤが配置され、走行の安定性を保証しています。
	このようにして、１本だけの不安定なレールの上を、安定して走ることが出来るのです。
	この車輪が存在することで、走行方向などが案内されるために、案内輪と言われています。
	写真は、ゴムタイヤがレールを挟んでいる様子です。
	上のほうと下のほうに、タイヤが分かれて並んでいるのが判ると思います。
	１本のレールを挟んで安定させる方式は、上記で判っていただけたと思います。

	架線は、コンクリートのレールに取り付けられているのです。
	写真のコンクリート軌条の側面に、細長い金属のレール（下側）が付いているのが、架線に当たる第三軌条なんです。
	実は、写真の反対側にも同じものがあります。
	これは、電気のプラスとマイナスがそれぞれ付いているのです。
	一般の電車では、架線からプラスの電気を取り入れると、マイナスの電気は線路に流しています。
	しかし、コンクリートのレールの上を走るモノレールでは、マイナス電気を流す電気のためのレールが別に必要になるのです。
