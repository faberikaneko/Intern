	ふだん私たちが「のし」という言葉を使う時には、主にのし紙（場合によってはのし袋）をさして使いますが、本来は、「のし（熨斗）」とは四角い色紙を細長く六角形になるようにひだをつけて折り畳み、中に細く切った熨斗鮑（のしあわび）を包んだものをさします。

	インフルエンザの種類
	ヒトに感染するインフルエンザウイルスには、Ａ型・Ｂ型・Ｃ型の３つがあり、現在流行の中心となっているのはＡ型とＢ型です。
	Ａ型は症状が重篤になる傾向があり、死に至ることもあります。
	また感染力が強いため、大流行（パンデミック）を起こしやすく、過去には香港かぜやスペインかぜなどの世界的な流行で多くの死者を出しました。
	２００９年に世界中で流行したいわゆる「新型インフルエンザ」は、Ａ型、Ｈ１Ｎ１亜型というものでした。
	Ｂ型は、Ａ型よりも症状が比較的軽く、限られた地域で流行するケースが見られます。
	Ｃ型は鼻かぜ程度の軽い症状ですむことが多いウイルスです。

	インフルエンザの治療
	【一般療法】
	できるだけ安静にし、栄養と十分な睡眠を取ります。
	インフルエンザウイルスの空気中での活動や感染を抑えるために、加湿器などで室内の湿度を５０～６０％に保ちます。
	水分を十分に補います。
	お茶、スープ、ジュースなど何でもいいので飲みたいものを飲みます。
	【対症療法】
	発熱や関節痛などに対しては解熱鎮痛薬、鼻水やくしゃみに抗ヒスタミン薬などが用いられます。
	一方、インフルエンザの症状はインフルエンザウイルスに対して免疫が正常に働いている結果であり、薬で無理に抑えないほうがよいという考え方もあります。
	市販の薬を自己判断で使用することは、かえって逆効果になる場合があるので、医師の指示にしたがってください。

	景気が回復する見通しは立っていない
	政策金利も０．１％のゼロ金利政策のまま
	日銀がマイナス金利を維持・拡大する可能性が高い
	日銀は金利ターゲットを導入した
	英国のＥＵ離脱の波及でさらに円高／株安、国債金利低下がすすむ可能性がある
	トランプ大統領就任によるドル高／円安／株高による住宅ローン金利上昇の影響は限定された範囲
	という理由から
	２０１７年は
	変動金利はそのままの低金利状態が維持される
	固定金利は金利ターゲットの影響で、１０年以上の固定金利はやや上昇。
	２年、３年、５年という短期金利はさらに低金利になる
	と予測されます。

	という関係にあります。
	買う人が増えると、金利が小さくても売れるため、国債の金利が下がるのです。
	逆に売り手が多くて、買い手が少ない状況だと、金利を高く設定しないと売れないため、国債金利が上がるのです。

	・硬毛化・多毛化
	産毛が濃く硬くなったり、生えていなかった場所から毛が生えることがあります。
	科学的原因はハッキリしていませんが、熱量が関係していると言われています。
	同じ熱量でも太い毛は熱を集めることができるので毛の抑制が上手くいきます。
	一方、産毛などに同じ熱量を照射した場合、メラニン色素が少ないため、熱を毛に上手く届けることができず、結果弱い熱量が毛に届きます。
	これが、成長を活性化させているという説が有力です。

	マンションなどで数株だけ栽培している時は、株ごと抜き取る事が出来ないことが多いので、その時は薬剤を利用することを検討して下さい。
	生育初期や収穫前の薬剤使用であれば、決められた量と決められた回数を守って使用すれば人体への影響は殆どありません。

	特許庁によると、商標登録の出願があった後で、手数料が支払われると、申請内容の審査が始まる。
	問題がなければ、６ヶ月程度で商標が登録されるという。
	一方、手数料の支払いがなかったり、（１）申請した商標を使った商品、サービスなどが実現する可能性が低い（２）他人が許可なく著名な名称で出願する（３）「五輪」のような公共性の高い名称を出願する−などに該当すると判断されたりした場合、登録が認められない。
	特許庁は、今回の「ＰＰＡＰ」の商標出願問題について、「個別の案件に関してはコメント差し控える」と回答。
	ただ、こうした審査基準に照らせば、大阪府の企業がピコ太郎側から承諾を得ていない場合、商標登録がされる可能性は低い。

	その後、５０万円で売却した場合、本来なら５０万円の損なのに、新取得価格との差額の２０万円が利益と見なされ課税されてしまうのだ。

	傾向としては、売買価格が年々下落しており、長期的な展望における農業への不安から、買い手の減少が最大の理由です。
	農地に限らず売買の対象においては、買い需要が売り需要を下回れば価格は下がり、逆なら上がりますので、農地は売り需要が勝っている現状と言えます。

	転用して売買する場合の注意点
	農地転用には２種類あります。
	農地の所有者が自ら農地以外の用途で使用する目的
	他者への売買を目的
	農地の所有者が自ら使用するための転用は、農地法４条による転用許可で、売買が目的の農地法５条による転用許可とは扱いが異なります。
	ただ、最終的に他者へ売却するのなら、２つの違いは転用のタイミングに過ぎません。
	先に転用してから売却するか、売却と同時に転用するかという違いです。
	転用はどちらが先でも同じように思えますが、転用許可の制度上、単に転用する許可申請は認められず、転用後の事業計画を必要とします。
	例えば、「とりあえず農地から宅地や雑種地にしておき、後から買主が現れるまで待つ」というような転用許可申請は認められません。

	農地売買の手数料
	農地として売る場合、個人間売買や農業関連機関の斡旋（あっせん）を利用する形態が主で、手数料は登記費用（登録免許税や司法書士報酬）くらいしか発生しません。
	転用による売買では、不動産会社に仲介依頼して売買できるので、登記費用の他にも不動産会社に対して仲介手数料を支払います。
	転用による売買では、転用前提であることを明示すれば、転用許可後に地目変更できるので、農地であっても宅地や雑種地同様に買いやすく、広く買主を探せます。
	したがって、売買価格も農地のまま売るよりも高くなることが想定され、不動産会社への仲介手数料も多くなります。

	『心配事の９割は起こらない』なんて本が話題になりましたが、実際アメリカで行われた研究の結果、「心配したことの“８５％”は、結局“いい結果”か“良くも悪くもない中立の結果”に終わる」んだとか。
	また、実際に心配事が現実になってしまった場合でも、約８割の人が「自分が想像していたよりも上手く出来事に対処できた！」と語っているそうです。
	「不安はそもそも現実にならないし、もしそうなっても何とかなる！」と科学的に証明されているのはなんだか心強いですね。
	心が押しつぶされてしまいそうな時は、ぜひこの結果を思い出してみて。

	答えやすくなる理由は、「すでに用意された選択肢のなかから、どれかひとつを選ぶだけで済む」ためです。
	自由回答型（ＦＡ）の項目の場合、回答者はゼロから記載する内容を考えざるを得なくなるので、圧倒的に回答ハードルは高くなります。

	設問の流れとしては、消費者が商品を知ったきっかけ～購入にいたるプロセス、購入後の満足度、今後の継続意向という順に聞くことが一般的です。
	回答者が思い起こしやすいよう、時系列をあわせる。
	また満足度については、先に総合満足度を聞き、その後に詳細満足度を聞くことがセオリーです。
	掘り下げていくような設問設計をする場合は、まずは総合的・一般的な質問をし、その後に詳細を聞くようにしましょう。
	※詳細満足度を先に聞くと、その内容が回答者の頭に入り総合満足度の結果が変わってしまう（バイアスがかかる）ことにつながります。
