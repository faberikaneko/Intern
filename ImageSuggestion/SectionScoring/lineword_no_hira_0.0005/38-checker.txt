	校庭から数メートル離れたマンゴーの木の下で、ジャネットさん（１４歳）がゴンベ・ワナ村の住民から大きな拍手を浴びています。
	ジャネットさんたちは、窃盗を巡って暴力的に衝突した村の２人の若者が、平和的に和解をする様子を描いた劇を演じました。
	ジャネットさんは数カ月前に学校の平和委員会に参加し、平和構築についての意識を高めるための活動を行っています。
	コンゴ民主共和国の農村部にあるこの地域には、バンツー族とピグミー族が暮らしています。
	ジャネットさんはピグミー族出身ですが、２つの民族が同じ地域で暮らすことで、時として紛争へと発展してしまうのです。
	２０１５年はじめにピグミー族とバンツー族の間で紛争が勃発し、ジャネットさんはマノノ地域にある村からの避難を強いられました。

	「今のように紛争後の状況では、学校が非常に重要な役割を果たします」と、ユニセフのチャンタル・カピンガ・ゼンバ教育専門官が語ります。
	「子どもたちが再び学校に通えるようになったということは、すべてにおいて、平和が戻ってきたという象徴なのです。それ以上に、学校は、共存への道を学ぶ機会を提供しています」
	平和的に共存するために
	ジャネットさんと地域の子どもたち。
	あらゆる人を受け入れ、調和的な生活を営むことができる能力は、まさに「平和のための学習プログラム」でユニセフが力を注いでいることです。
	このプログラムは、ユニセフ、オランダ政府、参加国の政府、そのほかの重要なパートナーの協力のもと実施されています。
	このイニシアチブは、紛争の危険がある地域や紛争後の復興段階にある地域を含め、紛争の影響を受ける地域のレジリエンス（回復力）や社会的統合、人間の安全保障の強化のために開始されました。
	特に、平和のための学習プログラムは、平和構築のための教育に関する政策や実施の強化を目指しています。
	「勉強だけでなく、子どもたちが自らの可能性を高め、平和に共存できるようにする力を身につけてほしいです」と、ゼンバ教育専門官が話します。
	学校でプログラムを行うことで、さまざまなレベルのコミュニティの人々に影響をもたらすことができます。
	まず、研修を受けた教員は、学校内で社会的統合を促進させる活動を率いていくことができます。
	研修を受けた教員の下で学習する子どもたちは、平和委員会に入ったり、コミュニティでの認識を高めるためのスポーツイベントや話し合い、劇を企画することで、平和をもたらす当事者になるのです。
	１０代の若者たちも、若者クラブで自分の意見を発表したり、活動を企画したりする機会を手にすることができます。
	学校は、異なる民族の人たちが一緒に集まる場所としての重要な役割も果たします。
	「子どもたちが一緒に遊んでいる姿を目することで、以前は特にＰＴＡや地域の活動で顔を合わせてもお互いに無視をしたり、交流を避けていた親たちも、相互理解をしていくのです」と、ムヒヤ校長先生が語ります。

	「この差別が地域の緊張の源となっており、わずかな火種がこのような状況にまで悪化してしまうことがあるのです」
	学校に通う子どもたちの姿は、平和の象徴
	ユニセフの支援のもと、政府は村の学校の再開に優先的に力を入れました。
