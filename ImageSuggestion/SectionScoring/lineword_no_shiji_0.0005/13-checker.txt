	人と地球の間で相互作用のある５つの変数（世界人口、工業化水準、公害の量、世界食量生産高、資源枯渇の進捗レート）を分析の結果、チームは「なんら抑制のないまま成長を続けるとやがて世界の資源供給は行き詰まり、２０３０年までには経済破綻に続き人口減少が起こり、人類衰退が始まる」との予測に至っています。

	「地球の限りある資源で人類が限りなく成長していったら、どうなる？」―それをコンピュータ・モデルでシミューレートし、全世界に衝撃を与えた問題の書『成長の限界（ＬｉｍｉｔｓｔｏＧｒｏｗｔｈ）』が出たのは１９７２年のことです。
	あれから４０年。
	驚くべきことに、ほぼこの予言通りのことが現実に起こっています。
	『成長の限界』は国際シンクタンク「ローマ・クラブ」の委嘱で、マサチューセッツ工科大学（ＭＩＴ）のドネラ・Ｈ．・メドウズ（ＤｏｎｅｌｌａＨ．Ｍｅａｄｏｗｓ）、デニス・Ｌ．・メドウズ（ＤｅｎｎｉｓＬ．Ｍｅａｄｏｗｓ）、ヨルゲン・ランダース（Ｊ？ｒｇｅｎＲａｎｄｅｒｓ）、ウィリアム・Ｗ．・ベーレンズ３世（ＷｉｌｌｉａｍＷ．ＢｅｈｒｅｎｓＩＩＩ）が調査し、まとめた本。
