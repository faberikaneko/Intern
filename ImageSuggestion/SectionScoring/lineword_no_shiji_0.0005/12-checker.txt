	語源とする説もいろいろとあるようですが、日本古来の音楽であります、「雅楽（ががく）」の中の一曲に、「千秋楽」という特別な曲があるそうです。
	こちらの楽曲が、必ず最後の曲として演奏されていた事にちなんで、最後日にかけて、「千秋楽」と呼び出したようです。
	また、呼び方を省略して「楽日（らくび）」と言ったり、最終日の先日のことを、「前楽（まえらく）」と言ったりもするそうです。
	「千秋」が略されているのですね。
	ちなみに「千穐楽」と記述する場合も多いようですが、これは「秋」の字に「火」が入っている為、その昔、火事の多かった繁華街では、火事を連想する「火」を意味嫌い「穐」と記述していたのだそうです。
	言葉一つにもいろいろなルーツがあって、調べてみると面白いものですね。
