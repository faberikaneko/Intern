	ビーナスベルト（ＢｅｌｔｏｆＶｅｎｕｓ）とは
	「ビーナスベルト」とは、日の出や日没時に見られる大気現象です。
	太陽と反対側の空に見られるピンク色の帯のことで、その下に見える藍色「地球影」あるいは「ダークセグメント（暗帯）」もセットで扱うことが多いようです。
	よく見られるのはアッシュピンクですが、場合によってはオレンジだったり多少の色幅が見られます。

	大気が澄んでて安定している冬季に多い
	太陽とは逆側の空で起こる
	朝焼け夕焼けが反対の空まで貫通したのがピンク部分（ビーナスベルト）
	一番下に見える地平線近くの藍色部分が地球自身の影（地球影）
	太陽が沈んでいる薄明中２０分程度の間に発生

	ビーナスベルト解説図
	ビーナスベルトのしくみ
	【追記：２０１５／１２／０９】判りにくいという声があるので図を書き足してみました。
	間違ってたら教えて下さい。
	観察できるのは日の出直前・日没直後
	「そしたら、観察できるのは日の出前って事になるんだけどなぁ．．．？」と思ったら、ちゃんと説明に薄明時って書いてありましたよ。
	（白目）
	実際に写真のタイムスタンプみたら夜明け１分前だったので条件に合致します。
	私が観測したのはかなり空が明るいときだったので、自分が夜側にいるという認識が全くありませんでした。
	理解が遅かったのもそのためですね。
	はい．．．すみません。
	ビーナスベルト以外でピンク色に見える空
	空がピンク色をしていても、すべてがビーナスベルトというわけではありません。
	朝焼け・夕焼け（レイリー散乱現象）
	朝焼け・夕焼けの空
	朝焼け・夕焼けによるピンク色の空【ＰＤ】
	これは普通に朝焼けや夕焼けの空。
	一方ビーナスベルトは太陽と反対側に出現します。
	空気全体が染まってるような空（ミー散乱？）
	ピンクに染まる空
	夕立が来そうなときに見られるＲＰＧのエフェクトっぽいピンク空
	また、ビーナスベルトはその名の通り帯状に色が付きます。
	こういう「ＲＰＧで中ボス出てきそうなパターン」は含みません。
	これは「空気中の水分が多すぎて一部ミー散乱している状態」ということになるのかなぁ。
	夕立起こりそうなときによく見る気がします。
	誰か教えてえらい人。
