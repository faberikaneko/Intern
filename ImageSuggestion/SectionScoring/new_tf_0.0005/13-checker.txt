	かと言ってギリシャみたいな緊縮財政を世界規模でやれば貧困が待ってるわけで．．．悩ましいですね。
	みなさんはどう？ひもじく貧しくとも地球いたわりながらずっと長く暮らすのがいい？それとも地球と人類を救うミラクル技術は経済発展の先にしかないって思う人？

	「地球の限りある資源で人類が限りなく成長していったら、どうなる？」―それをコンピュータ・モデルでシミューレートし、全世界に衝撃を与えた問題の書『成長の限界（ＬｉｍｉｔｓｔｏＧｒｏｗｔｈ）』が出たのは１９７２年のことです。
	あれから４０年。
	驚くべきことに、ほぼこの予言通りのことが現実に起こっています。
	『成長の限界』は国際シンクタンク「ローマ・クラブ」の委嘱で、マサチューセッツ工科大学（ＭＩＴ）のドネラ・Ｈ．・メドウズ（ＤｏｎｅｌｌａＨ．Ｍｅａｄｏｗｓ）、デニス・Ｌ．・メドウズ（ＤｅｎｎｉｓＬ．Ｍｅａｄｏｗｓ）、ヨルゲン・ランダース（Ｊ？ｒｇｅｎＲａｎｄｅｒｓ）、ウィリアム・Ｗ．・ベーレンズ３世（ＷｉｌｌｉａｍＷ．ＢｅｈｒｅｎｓＩＩＩ）が調査し、まとめた本。
