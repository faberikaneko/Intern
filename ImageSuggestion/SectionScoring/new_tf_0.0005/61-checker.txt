	これが受験生の理解ですが実際にはもう少し深い要素があります。
	それは英語が唯一の「真の積み重ね型の教科」ということです。
	地歴公民は中学校でも習いますが、高校では初めからもう一度習います。
	例えば日本史なら高校で改めて縄文時代から学び直します。
	理科も同様です。
	国語は中学のときに苦手科目であっても、高校から力を入れれば伸びてきます（漢検３級程度の基礎は必要）。
	数学は積み重ねの要素が多少ありますが、英語ほどではなく挽回が可能です。
	？一方英語は中３や高１で苦手教科だった場合には、浪人して人並み勉強をしても苦手が改善されない科目です。
	人の３倍程度勉強時間をとってもなお変化はありません。
	「真の積み重ね型の教科」である英語は、基礎が不十分な場合、スタート時の偏差値が５０ならずっと５０のまま、４５ならずっと４５のまま終わることが多い、逆転が難しい科目です。

	関西の場合．．．京産桃山→関関立→同志社
	国立の場合．．．地方国立→都市近郊の国立→旧帝大
	しかし、２番手（ＭＡＲＣＨ等）と最上位（早慶等）の間には勉強量で乗り越えられない壁があることも事実です。
	？早慶、旧帝大、同志社大などの最上位に合格する生徒には以下のような特徴があります。
	・小中学校では、理解できない授業がほとんどなく自然体で上位にいた。
	・苦手科目はあるが、総じて勉強が好き。
	または特に苦にならない。
	・受験勉強を通じて新たな発見があり興味がわくことがよくある。
	・参考書の暗記事項を隠して覚える、チェックペンで覚えるといった受け身の勉強法をほとんど用いず、自分なりの勉強法を見つけつつある。
	・計算（理系）または活字を読むこと（文系）に苦手意識はほとんどない。
	・何も考えずに過ごすことが苦手で、常に考えごとをしてしまう。
	・適度にざわざわした環境よりも、まったくの無音空間のほうが勉強がはかどる。
	？全ての受験生に最上位に合格する可能性があることは否定しませんが、高校や予備校の少なくとも５年以上指導経験がある先生に相談してみることも大切です。
	ただし最上位（早慶等）を狙う生徒が２番手（ＭＡＲＣＨ等）で止まるケースが大半ですので、ひとつ上を本気で目指すことは重要です。
	この項でお話したのは、無謀な受験計画を立てないようにという意味です。

	？大学受験において英語の配点が高いのは、今後のグローバル社会に合わせてという理由ではありません。
	英語の点数が高いことが、中１から高３にかけて一度もサボらなかったことの証明になるからという要素があります。
	逆に言えば、中３高１までさかのぼって英語の勉強を計画的に行えば、伸ばすことは不可能ではありません。
	英語の苦手な浪人生が失敗するのは、初めから大学受験レベルの問題集に取り組むからです。
	失敗例３授業を受けるだけで、伸びなかった
	小学生
	？中高一貫校出身の生徒は関係ありませんが、高校受験を経験した生徒は「もう一度同じことをすれば良いんでしょ？」と１年を過ごし失敗することがあります。
	特に中３のときに塾に通っていた生徒ほど失敗しやすくなります。
	？その理由は高校受験塾がやや過保護すぎることにあります。
	高校には中学生のほぼ全員が進むため、勉強下手な生徒も多くいます。
	そのため塾側が授業、宿題、問題集、自習室の管理を通じて、塾に来るだけである程度得点できるシステムを作り上げています。
	高校受験塾経験者（特に成功組やあまり深く考えずに受験した生徒）は、「もう一度同じことをすれば良いんでしょ？」と予備校や塾の授業を受けることで満足してしまい成績が伸びないことが良くあります。

	マラソン
	？勉強、資格、ビジネスなどあらゆるものごとは最初の１０００時間を越えることで見える世界が変わると言われています。
	例えば運動神経ゼロの高校生が、夏休みに１日８時間本気で練習に取り組めば、９月には苦手意識がなくなり次の段階が見えるようになっています。
	？受験の教科に関しては、予備校講師と大学受験総括責任者を経験した筆者の感覚から言えば「３００時間」が苦手脱出のめどになります。
	例えば数学が苦手で浪人をしてしまったなら、３月に１日１０時間数学の勉強に取り組んでみてください。
	４月には数学の問題が「楽しい」または「それほど苦でない」というレベルに必ず上がります。
	失敗例９４月からまたは夏から本格始動する
	子どもベンチ森
	？予備校の授業が４月からであるため、４月から勉強を始動しようという人がいます。
	失敗例８で説明したように、３月の１ヶ月だけで苦手科目をひとつ克服できるだけの勉強時間が取れます。
	３月に休む人の言い分はたいてい「猛勉強したから充電をしたい」となりますが、１８歳前後の人間の脳は１年半程度の猛勉強の連続には簡単に耐えます（２浪目の場合は１ヶ月休ませても良い）。
	浪人が決まったその日からスタートするのが当然です。
	？浪人しても１学期をマイペースで流し、夏以降（ひどいと９月以降）に本格的なモードに切り替える人がいます。
	多くの受験生は遅くとも４月に完全なスタートを切っていますので、夏以降の本格スタートは論外となります。
	【まとめ】「浪人生」９つの失敗例を予備校講師が指摘
	失敗例１夜型生活になり伸びなかった
	失敗例２英語が伸びなかった
	失敗例３授業を受けるだけで、伸びなかった
	失敗例４大学に進んだ同級生と遊んでしまった
	失敗例５理科、数学の質問環境がなかった
	失敗例６文系数学と理系国語で失敗

	？【１】夜２２時ごろで勉強を打ち切ること
	後がない浪人生は不安からつい深夜まで勉強をしてしまいます。
	しかし２２時以降は人体の体内時計（時計遺伝子）が作動してリラックスモード（＝副交感神経優位）に自動的に入ります。
	この時間に机に向かっていると、脳は覚醒物質を出して作業を継続させようとします。
	わかりやすくいえばカフェイン入りのドリンク剤を飲みながら勉強をしているのに近い状況です。
	これは「偽の集中力」ということができ、実際の学力は伸びてこないことが多くなります。
	どんなに絶好調だと感じても必ず２２時には勉強を打ち切って、２３時の就寝を目指すことがカギになります。
	２３時に就寝すると６時頃に目が覚めやすくなります。
	なお休日の「寝だめ」は効果がないばかりか大きく調子を崩すことにつながります。
	少しゆっくりしたくても、＋２時間の睡眠（６時に起きる習慣がある人は、８時）が限度となります。
