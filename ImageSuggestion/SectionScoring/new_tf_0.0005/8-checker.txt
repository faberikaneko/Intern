	サロン脱毛のメリット
	痛みが少ない。
	または感じない場合が多い
	出力はそれほど高くないので医療脱毛より火傷のリスクが低い
	料金は月額制など様々な支払い方法がある
	サロンなので入るのも恥ずかしくない
	店舗が沢山展開されていて通いやすい
	完了までの期間が早さに関しては医療脱毛にはかないませんが、デメリットを考えると、まずはサロン脱毛に通うことをオススメできます。

	・硬毛化・多毛化
	産毛が濃く硬くなったり、生えていなかった場所から毛が生えることがあります。
	科学的原因はハッキリしていませんが、熱量が関係していると言われています。
	同じ熱量でも太い毛は熱を集めることができるので毛の抑制が上手くいきます。
	一方、産毛などに同じ熱量を照射した場合、メラニン色素が少ないため、熱を毛に上手く届けることができず、結果弱い熱量が毛に届きます。
	これが、成長を活性化させているという説が有力です。

	例えば、通い始めて、耐えられない痛みを感じた場合、まぁいいやで済ませれない金額を支払います。
	こうなると後悔してしまいますよね。
	なので、まずは脱毛がどれくらいの刺激なのか感じるためにも光脱毛から通うのが理想的です。
	サロン脱毛の月額制の場合は、習い事のような感覚で月ごとに一定額の支払いです。
	更に、いつでも辞めることができます。
	なので、一定期間、光脱毛に通っても効果を感じられなかった場合に医療脱毛を検討するのがオススメです。
	しかし、「光脱毛を選択して良かった」と多くの方が効果を実感されています。
	まずは光脱毛をやってみようという気持ちで始めたとしても、きっと満足していただけると思いますよ♪

	・お金がかかる
	脱毛サロンで脱毛を完了させるためには平均２〜３年の継続が必須です。
	部位脱毛のような回数プランの場合は料金がわかりやすいですが、全身脱毛の場合は、月々の料金を抑えられる月額制プランが人気で総費用がわかりにくくなっています。
	月額プランは１回の脱毛が全身１回ではなく、全身を１／２〜１／６に分けて脱毛施術をしていきます。
	１回の脱毛範囲が狭いほど、脱毛完了までの期間が長くなり、料金も高くなります。
	毎月が安くても、２年も３年も払い続けるとなると、思っていた以上の金額が発生します。
	月額料金の平均金額は１００００円なので、通常２４００００円ほどの支払いが必要になります。
	対策
	月額料金が安いサロン＋全身を１／２づつ進められるサロンを選択する
	月額１００００円で１／６づつ進む→全身１回６００００円→１年間で全身２回→１２回達成するのに６年→７２００００円
	月額１００００円で１／２づつ進む→全身１回２００００円→１年間で全身６回→１２回達成するのに２年→２４００００円
	毎月が安くても、２年も３年も払い続けるとなると、思っていた以上の金額が発生するんですよ。
	契約するときには月額費用だけでなく、総費用も確認しておくことをオススメします。

	・毛嚢炎のリスク
	カミソリなどの自己処理に比べると毛嚢炎ができる確率は低いですが、ゼロではありません。
	毛穴が少し傷ついただけで毛嚢炎はできることがあります。
	光脱毛では、熱を利用してムダ毛にダメージを与える仕組みなので、毛根周辺の毛包や表皮にも多少の熱ダメージが残ります。
	脱毛施術後の肌は一時的にバリア機能が下がりやすいので、ブドウ球菌がダメージを受けた毛包に入り込んできて、毛嚢炎を引き起こしてしまうことがあります。

	・毛が生えてこなくなる
	毛をなくすことを目的に通ってはいますが、脱毛が完了すると半永久的に毛が生えてこなくなります。
	そうすると、元に戻すことができなくなるのでデメリットにもなる場合があります。
	・毛が生えてこなくなる
	毛をなくすことを目的に通ってはいますが、脱毛が完了すると半永久的に毛が生えてこなくなります。
	そうすると、元に戻すことができなくなるのでデメリットにもなる場合があります。
	例えばＶＩＯのお手入れの場合だと、一度ハイジニーナ（パイパン）のスタイルで脱毛が完了するとずっとそのままということです。
	対策方法
	・刺激や紫外線を感じやすくなる
	毛には体を保護する働きがあります。
	この毛がなくなることで今まで感じていなかった刺激や紫外線を直に感じやすくなります。
	対策
	体を洗う時や洋服の摩擦に気をつけることと、紫外線のケアを今まで以上に行う必要があります。
	脱毛直後はメラニンに刺激が加わっているため特に紫外線対策を強化することをオススメします！
	・脱毛前後は日焼けができない
	脱毛サロンに通う方の中で肌を焼きたいと思う方もいらっしゃると思いますが、脱毛前後の日焼けはＮＧです。
	脱毛後は肌が敏感になっているため、紫外線を浴びることで肌荒れを起こす場合がある為です。
	また、脱毛は１度の施術では終わりません。
	脱毛後にガン黒に焼いてしまうと、次の脱毛施術が受けられない場合があります

	上記の表で着目していただきたいのは脱毛完了までの総費用です。
	一見お得に見える自己処理ですが、２００円のカミソリで自己処理をし続けると、１２９６０００円もかかるのは驚きですよね。
	費用・手間・時間もかかる自宅での自己処理は効率が悪いうえに、肌荒れのリスクは１番高いためオススメできません。
	カミソリでのお手入れって安く済ませたいからしてることなのに、総費用がこんなにかかるなんて驚き・・・それならサロン脱毛で安全に脱毛したほうがいいね・・・
	光脱毛ｖｓ医療脱毛
	大きな違いは使用する機械の出力と毛根を破壊できるかにあります。
	毛根を破壊していいかは法律で決まっているので、サロンでの脱毛で毛根を破壊することは禁止されています。
	光脱毛
	出力が弱く毛根は破壊してはいけない
	医療脱毛
	出力が高く毛根を破壊できる
	毛根を破壊できたほうが脱毛完了までの期間がグッと縮まります。
	これだけ聞くと、医療脱毛の方がいいの？となりがちですが、医療脱毛にもデメリットがあります。

	・肌が乾燥しやすくなる
	光脱毛は施術時に光の熱エネルギーを使用するため、熱が水分を奪い肌が乾燥しやすくなります。
	また、毛の原料はタンパク質で、タンパク質を凝固させることで毛の成長を抑制していきます。
	この、タンパク質が固まる際に多くの水分を必要とするため一時的に肌が乾燥してしまいます。
