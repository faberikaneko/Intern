	相撲や歌舞伎、演劇の最終公演日のことを「千秋楽（せんしゅうらく）」と言いますが、こちらの意味は、みなさんご存知ですか？なぜこのように呼ばれるようになったのか、疑問に思いましたので、ちょっと調べてみました。

	「香川県に勝とうなんて恐れ多いこと」
	こうした中で、埼玉県入間市在住の会社員らが「埼玉を日本一の『うどん県』にする会」を組織。
	現在、県内のうどんをＰＲする活動の一環として「東京大学うどん部」と食べ歩きながら、フェイスブックに魅力的なうどん店を紹介している。
	２０１６年２月１３日には、入間市の農村環境改善センターで、東京大学うどん部の学生６人を招いて「入間流のうどん打ち」を伝授するイベントを開く予定。
	「埼玉を日本一の『うどん県』に！」と、熱を込める。
	彼らのこうした活動に、インターネットでは、
	「うどん用小麦粉使用量、香川県民は一人あたり約６０キログラム、埼玉県民は３．６キログラム。香川県超えはムリなんじゃないかな・・・」
	「うどんばかり食べてると香川県民になるぞｗｗｗ」
	「埼玉県民だけど、香川県に勝とうなんて恐れ多いことたぶん人口の１％も考えてないと思う」
	「香川県民は埼玉県民の１４倍うどん食ってるわけで、相手にならない計算ｗｗｗ」
	などと、香川県には敵わないとの声が少なくない。
	香川県民だろうか、
	「そんな甘くねえんだよ。香川県民のうどん好きをなめんじゃねーぞ！！！」
	といった声もあった。
	また、
	「香川県民どれだけうどん好きなの．．．あたまおかしいｗｗｗ」
	「香川県民１日１食はうどんって、食い過ぎじゃね。うどんがないと死んじゃうんか？」
	と、かえって「うどん県香川」の実力を浮かび上がらせてしまったようでもある。
	たしかにデータのうえでは、埼玉県は第２位ではあるものの、トップの香川県との差は小さくない。
	埼玉県は「（地域ごとのＰＲ活動など）さまざまな取り組みがあることは承知していますが、今のところ、県をあげて取り組んでいこうという機運にはありません」と、盛り上がりはいま一歩のよう。
	と話している。

	結納品にはおめでたい７品目、９品目などが定められており、水引きは一度結んだらほどけない「結びきり」を使います（実際に用いられる結納飾りの水引きの結び方は結び切りをアレンジした非常に豪華なものになっています）。
	◎細かいことですが、当日持参する手土産や、（仲人をたてる場合には）仲人への謝礼に用いるのし袋も「結びきり」のものを使います。
	右の画像は、仲人への謝礼の記載例です。
	両家それぞれが、寿の熨斗袋の中には結納金の１〜２割程度を包みます。
	また女性側はもう一つ「お車代」ののし袋も用意します。

	アジャイルプロセスでは、プロジェクトの早い段階から「動くコード」を作成します。
	当然、機能はまったく足りないかもしれませんが、実装したところまでは動かすことができるコードになっているはずです。
	また、小さく作りこんでいくプロセスなので、サイクルごとにかじ取りの判断ができ、顧客からの要望が取り入れやすいのが特徴です。
	アジャイルプロセスの基本スタンスは、変化を受け入れることで、要求の変更が前提に考えられています。
	ＰｒｏｊｅｃｔＫｅｅｐｅｒ／ＳａｌｅｓＦｏｒｃｅＡｕｔｏｍａｔｉｏｎ＋の開発プロセス
	最初のバージョンの開発が始まってから約４年がたちましたが、当初はメンバー約２名で立ち上げました。
	自社製のＷｅｂシステム構築用のフレームワークがあったことや、受託開発でさまざまなシステムを構築した経験があったメンバーであったため２名で約６ヶ月の期間で開発を行うことはできました。
	当初はパッケージ開発におけるノウハウはほとんどなかったため、受託開発時に当時よく使っていたウォーターフォール手法を必然的に採用しました。
	しかし、パッケージ製品の開発においては延々と開発を継続していかなければならず、受託開発のように納品することで、開発が完了するわけではありません。
	製品は日々進化する必要があり、顧客からのフィードバックをスムーズに製品に取り入れていかなければ、製品の魅力を維持することができません。
	仕様変更、機能拡張がたびたび発生していく状況では、各機能間の整合性や品質を維持することが困難になり、開発プロセスをより仕様変更に強いアジャイル開発手法へスイッチすることで、柔軟な仕様変更、スピーディーな製品リリースを行うことができるようになりました。
	昨今では多種多様なシステムが身の回りに存在しています。
	さまざまなシステムを目にし、操作することで、古いシステムの操作性や機能へ不満を抱く機会も多くなるでしょう。
	このような顧客を常に満足させるためには、システムは常に進化していかなければならず、おのずと今後の開発手法の主流はアジャイルへと進んでいくのではないでしょうか？

	１シリーズから７シリーズまで、ＢＭＷのラインナップはほぼＦＲを採用していますが、２０１５年にＢＭＷは２シリーズ・アクティブツアラーとグランツアラーというＦＦを採用したモデルを追加しています。
	ＢＭＷでは初のＦＦモデルですが、さすがはＦＲにこだわり続けてきたブランド。
	ＦＦのデメリットを極限まで減らし、実にＦＲのようなフィーリングを楽しめる味付けになっています。
	ＢＭＷはたとえ駆動方式がＦＦとなっても、味付けの基本はＦＲなのです。

	もしかしたら、今後の映像制作において「光」というのは表現の新たなベクトルになるのかもしれません。
	今後舞台でいうところの照明係のような仕事が、アニメ制作の世界でも確立するのではないでしょうか。
	また、これまで技術上表現が不可能だったことで可能になることも多いでしょう。
	アニメは原作者の意図をますます反映したものになると思われます。
	これまであきらめていたであろうものが実現化することを考えると、わくわくしてきます。
	今回の視聴においても、原作を読んでいる身としては、単に映像がきれいになっただけではなく、より原作の世界観を出せたことで魅力を増した部分もあるなと感じました。
	とはいえ、最初は表現の豊かさに慣れず、「不気味の谷」のような抵抗を感じる人もいるかもしれません。
	でも、最初はどんなテクノロジーに関してもあるものでしょうし、触れていく中で、よりよいものが見つかったり、ユーザーに合わせて洗練されたりして、定着していくものでしょう。
	今後ＨＤＲを介して、どんな魅力的な作品が出てくるのか？それがＮｅｔｆｌｉｘのような配信サービスを通して、色々な国で楽しむことができる．．．。
	新たな時代が始まる予感を感じるとともに、これからが楽しみでなりません。

	後輪駆動式は前輪駆動式よりも優れている
	ＢＭＷＪａｐａｎ
	ＢＭＷでは常識ですが．．．コンパクト・セグメントでは初めてのＦＲ（フロントエンジン＋後輪駆動）
	ＢＭＷのクルマは全て、車体前部に縦に置かれたエンジンから生み出されるパワーをリア・ホイールへと伝達させます。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズも例外ではありません。
	後輪駆動方式は伝統的なＢＭＷの特徴であり、魅力的な走り、優れたトラクション、安心できるハンドリングを実現する大事な要素なのです。
	後輪駆動の有効性は、荷物を積むほど高まります。
	前輪を駆動するクルマでは、満載状態になると前車軸への荷重が減少して、トラクションに悪影響を及ぼします。
	ＢＭＷ１シリーズならば、このようなことは起こりません。

	そう考えると、ＦＲというのはメリットとデメリットの両面から考えても、高級車に採用されやすい、ということになるわけです。
	トヨタのクラウンや日産のＦＵＧＡ、メルセデス・ベンツの大部分やＢＭＷやジャガーなど、高級車では軒並みＦＲが採用されています。
	そんな中、前回も冒頭で書きましたが、ホンダというのは、ほとんどＦＦ専業メーカーと言ってもよく、最高級セダンであるレジェンドにもＦＦが採用されています。
	ホンダはおそらくＦＦの高級車でも売れると思って出したんだと思いますが、やはりマーケットにはほとんど受け入れられませんでした。
	トヨタのクラウンが毎月数千台規模で売れるのに対し、ホンダのレジェンドは数百台かそれ以下です。
	今後、ＦＲの製造ラインを持たないホンダがレジェンドをどうして行くのか、ちょっと注目したいところです。

	ヨーロッパ金融危機はゴールドマン・サックスと、リーマン・ブラザースが仕組んだ筋書き。
	以下は、ｗａｎｔｏｎのブログ
	リンクからの引用です。
	２１世紀、世界大不況の、本当の、原因
	２０１１年現在の、世界不況・金融恐慌を引き起こし、倒産した銀行リーマン・ブラザーズ。
	現在、ヨーロッパ各国政府が倒産の危機に立たされている、
	ヨーロッパ金融危機の「正体」は、この世界金融恐慌である。
	デリバティヴ・ヘッジファンドといったギャンブ？ル投機によって、世界中の銀行・政府に、多額の借金を背負わせ、自身も倒産し、人類全体を大不況と、第３次世界大戦の危機に直面させ、姿を消した、リーマン・ブラザース。
	このリーマン・ブラザースは、元々、アメリカ南北戦争の際、北軍＝エイブラハム・リンカーンの勢力の「軍需物資」の調達会社であった。
	このリンカーン本人が、アメリカ政府の諜報・スパイ組織に育成された「スパイ」であり、南部に潜入活動を繰り返していた「スパイ」であった事は、良く知られている。
	リンカーンの目的は、アメリカ南部に潜入し、南部の地下資源、農場等の資産を「査定」し、南北戦争を起こし、南部の資産を北部が「略奪」すれば、その利益が、どれくらいになるか「事前に調査する事であった」。

	リーマン・ブラザースは、１０００兆円損をし、倒産する。
	１０００兆円分の「証券」を買っていた世界中の政府・銀行が、累計１０００兆円の損失を出し、倒産の危機に追い込まれる。
	このギャンブル投機に勝利した、ゴールドマン・サックスは、１０００兆円の利益を得る。
	この「利益」が、世界大不況の原因である。
	大量の失業者、第３次世界大戦の危機の原因である。
	そして誰も、ゴールドマン・サックスと、リーマン・ブラザースが、「事実上、同一の会社」であった事を指摘しない。
	ゴールドマン・サックスが、ニューヨーク・ダウの先物を大量に売り浴びせ、ダウが１１０００ドルを「超えない」＝ゴールドマン・サックスの勝利を生み出したその先物の売買の資金を、ゴールドマン・サックスに与えていたのは、リーマン・ブラザース本人である。
	リーマン・ブラザースは倒産して姿を消す。
	姿を消したものは、誰も非難出来ない。
	「自己責任で、倒産し、ギャンブル投機の責任を取った」、と評される。
	南軍と戦争を行う北軍の「味方」をしつつ、敵軍に兵器と資金を提供していた、リーマン・ブラザース。
	南軍と、北軍は、資金源と兵器の供給源が「同一」であった。
	ゴールドマン・サックスと、ギャンブル投機で戦争を行う「敵」であったはずのリーマン・ブラザースが、ゴールドマン・サックスに資金を提供していた。
	ゴールドマン・サックス＝リーマン・ブラザースは、資金供給源が、「同一」であった。
	ゴールドマン・サックスは、１０００兆円を、「持ち逃げした」。
	その１０００兆円の赤字で、世界中の政府・銀行が、倒産しつつある。
	現在、倒産したリーマン・ブラザースの、旧経営陣は、「別の名前の、新しい会社を作り」ギャンブル投機を再開している。
	この旧経営陣の「新しい」ギャンブル投機会社は、
	当然、ゴールドマン・サックスのビジネスパートナー・企業である。

	５つの事例を順に見ていきましょう。
	事例１のココリコ遠藤さんのケースは、一般的な上場株式の売買で損が出たわけではありません。
	「上場していない、一般には手に入らない株を買わないか？」「レアな株だからちょっと持っているだけで倍になるよ」と騙されてしまったものです。
	少し調べて勉強すれば「そんな美味しい話があるはずがない」ことは分かるはずですが、勉強不足が故に冷静さを欠いてしまったと言わざるを得ません。
	事例２は「ジェイコム事件」とも言われ、世間を騒がせました。
	プロである証券マンが注文時に価格と数量を反対に入力してしまい、大損害が出た事例です。
	不注意以外の何物でもありません。
	先にやや極端な事例を紹介しましたが、事例３－４は多くの個人投資家が直面しているケースです。
	事例３は、「トヨタなら大丈夫」と何となく株を買ったら、リーマンショックで株価が暴落し、大損したというものです。
	ご本人が「何も考えていなかった」とおっしゃっている通り、不勉強そのものです。
	加えて、この方は「何％株価が下がったら売却する」という損切りルールを定め、実行しなかったものと思われます。
	事例４は株主優待名人として有名な桐谷さんのインタビューです。
	桐谷さんほど株に詳しく取引経験も豊富なベテランですが、損切りができずに損失を出すことがあるそうです。
	桐谷さんは多くの銘柄に分散投資しているため、１銘柄で大損してもそれで破産するということはないようですが、ベテランでも損切りは難しいことを物語っています。

	ここでは、実際にネット上で確認された大損事例を見ながら、大損・大失敗事例の共通項は何か、そして大損・大失敗を回避して賢くお金を増やすにはどうすれば良いかをお話します。
	まずは、５つの大損事例を見てください。
	社会問題レベルの大きな話から、一個人の感想レベルのものまで幅広いですが、いずれもネットメディアで報じられた事例です。
	大損事例１－未公開株詐欺
	お笑いコンビ・ココリコの遠藤章造（４４）が、１９日に読売テレビで放送された「黄金列伝！」に相方の田中直樹（４４）とコンビで出演。
	タレント・千秋との離婚の裏に、未公開株詐欺にひっかかり、数千万円の大金を失ったことが影響していたことを明かした。
	～中略～「未公開のアレ（株）なんで、２週間置いてるだけで、倍になります」と言われ、手を出したことを告白。
	（２０１５／７／１９デイリースポーツオンライン）
	大損事例２－誤発注
	２００５年１２月８日午前９時２７分、東証マザーズ市場に新規上場した総合人材サービス会社ジェイコムの株式（発行済み株式数１４５００株）に関して、みずほ証券の担当者が「６１万円１株売り」と注文すべきところを「１円６１万株売り」と誤ってコンピューターに入力。

	全体的に金利が低下しておりますが、当初１０年固定金利とフラット３５金利が大幅に低下しているのが明確にわかるかと思います。
	※トランプ大統領就任によるドル高／円安、金利ターゲットの影響で２０１６年８月以降がやや金利が上昇しています。
	２０１６年の当初１０年固定金利とフラット３５金利が大幅に低下した理由
	・日銀のマイナス金利政策の影響が大きい
	・変動金利はそれほど変わっていない事実
	変動金利→政策金利と連動します。
	政策金利によって銀行は日銀から資金を調達して、住宅ローンで融資して利ザヤを稼ぐビジネスモデルですから、政策金利が変動金利と連動するのです。
	「１年で変動金利０．８００％→０．６４４％」という結果ですが、これはメガバンクがそろって変動金利を引き下げたからであって、ネット銀行単体で見ると

	マイナス金利を推しすすめるためには銀行からの圧力が大きい→マイナス金利が国債金利にも波及し、銀行や保険会社の経営状況が悪化した
	国債買い入れは辞められない→辞めたら投資家に見限られて円高株安になってしまい、アベノミクスが失敗に終わる
	という板挟みの状況に陥っていました。
	そこで９月２０日の金融政策決定会合で「金利ターゲット」という金融政策の導入を決めたのです。

	・英国のＥＵ離脱が起こすユーロ安と他国への影響
	２０１６年６月に英国でＥＵ離脱の国民投票が行われ「離脱」が５２％で勝利をしました。
	英国はＥＵ加盟による移民の受け入れで、自国民の失業率が増え、低所得層に不満が高まってしまったことがこの結果を招いたのです。
	ＥＵに参加していることで、ＥＵ内でのビジネスや人、お金の移動がスムーズになりそれが経済的にプラスになっている側面もありながら、自国の利益が脅かされていると考える人が多いのです。
	実際には、この現象は英国だけではないのです。
	フランスでも、ドイツでも、「ＥＵに多額の予算を払って、他の貧しいＥＵ参加国の面倒を見るのはおかしい。」と考える方がかなりの数いるのです。
	今回の英国国民投票の結果は、他のＥＵ参加国のＥＵ離脱推進派に勢いを与えるものであり、同じような事例が増える可能性があるのです。

	これ以上マイナス金利になれば、個人が銀行に預ける預金がマイナス金利になったり、海外のように口座管理手数料が発生したり、する可能性もあるのです。
	当然、こうなれば家計への影響は絶大であり、さらに消費を冷え込ませる要因にもなりかねないのです。
	・マイナス金利拡大を日銀が推し進めざるをえない理由
	国債買入れの量的緩和も限界。
	うち手がない
	マイナス金利を導入する前から、物価目標を達成するために、国債を日銀が買い取ることで市場に出回るお金を増やしてインフレ誘導をしてきたのです。
	しかし、円高・株安という流れには抗えずに、結果が全然ついてこないという状況があり、マイナス金利を導入したのです。
	国債を買い取る予算にも限界がありますし、効果もほとんど発揮しないことが証明されてしまったため、国債買入れは続けると明言されているものの、限界に達していることは明らかなのです。
	そのため、マイナス金利拡大も視野に入れているのです。

	日銀の黒田東彦総裁は４月２８日にマイナス金利政策について「必要があればまだまだいくらでも拡大できる」と話しています。
	確かに日銀のマイナス金利適用は、銀行の預入資産の一部、「基礎残高」「マクロ加算残高」を超えた「政策金利残高」に対してのみとなっています。
	「基礎残高」「マクロ加算残高」「政策金利残高」すべてにマイナス金利を適用することも日銀にはできるのです。

	例えば、通い始めて、耐えられない痛みを感じた場合、まぁいいやで済ませれない金額を支払います。
	こうなると後悔してしまいますよね。
	なので、まずは脱毛がどれくらいの刺激なのか感じるためにも光脱毛から通うのが理想的です。
	サロン脱毛の月額制の場合は、習い事のような感覚で月ごとに一定額の支払いです。
	更に、いつでも辞めることができます。
	なので、一定期間、光脱毛に通っても効果を感じられなかった場合に医療脱毛を検討するのがオススメです。
	しかし、「光脱毛を選択して良かった」と多くの方が効果を実感されています。
	まずは光脱毛をやってみようという気持ちで始めたとしても、きっと満足していただけると思いますよ♪

	信頼のできる実績あるサロンを選択しましょう。
	大手サロンは実績・経験共に豊富のためオススメです。
	また、レーザー脱毛の方が出力が高い機械を使用するため火傷のリスクが高くなります。
	まずは、サロンの光脱毛から始めるのがオススメです。
	安全性が高いと言っても熱を利用した施術なので火傷のリスクがゼロとは言えません。
	このことを頭において、信頼できるサロンを選ぶのがポイントです。

	対策
	脱毛後は肌が敏感なため色素沈着を起こしやすい状態です。
	紫外線や肌への刺激を避けるようにしましょう。
	脱毛後の日焼け対策ってサロンで絶対説明されるけど、案外忘れがちなんだよね・・・気をつけないと怖いね！

	これは何か関係があるに違いない！
	そう思い込んで所縁ある（？）土地にノープランで足を踏み入れたんですけど、地名が書いてあるだけで徳谷の表札を掲げている家も見当たらず、真夏のムワっとした風だけが歓迎してくれているようでした。
	なんだよ、もっと劇的なヒントとかないの？六角レンチを使って回したら開く扉とかないの？
	そんな都合よくありません。
	というわけで、せっかくここまで来たんだからと最寄りの交番に飛び込みました。
	この土地を守り続けてきた警察なら何か知ってるはず！
	「すみません。この土地と同じ徳谷という共通点だけで東京からやってきたんですが、徳谷地域に詳しい方はいませんでしょうか？」
	「え、そんな理由だけで来たの？申し訳ないけど、徳谷地域の由来なんて聞いたことないなぁ。そもそも、徳谷地域に徳谷姓の家は一軒もないんだよね」
	「ええー！１人もいないんですか！？勝手に所縁があると思い込んでたんですが、全然関係なかったんですかね．．．」
	「ご期待に応えられなくてごめんね。あっ、この近くに土佐神社（しなねさま）があるから、そこの宮司さんなら何か知ってるかも」
	「ありがとうございます！早速行ってみます！」

	いきなり訪ねるのも失礼かと思いつつ、長年疑問だった「徳谷の謎」が明らかになるかと思うと居ても立ってもいられませんでした。
	インディー・ジョーンズっていつもこんな気持ちなのかな。
	「山本先生、突然お邪魔してすみません。改めて徳谷と申します」
	「いやぁ、こんなところまでよくて来てくれました」
	「徳谷姓のルーツが想像以上に興味深かったので驚きました。殿様の一言で徳谷になっただなんて。ケチ谷のままだったら小学校でいじめられていたかもしれません」
	「先ほどの話の続きですが、明治の平民苗字必称義務令でこの徳谷地域に住んでいた人たちが徳谷と名乗ったんでしょう。その土地にちなんだ苗字を名乗る人が大半でしたからね。あなたも高知から全国に渡り住んだ人の子孫の可能性は高いでしょう」
	「おおおお．．．。なるほど、納得感あります。僕は大阪出身なんですが、高知と大阪の距離を考えると全然あり得ますね。一度会ったことのある徳谷（とくや）智史さんは京都出身でしたし」
	「とくだに、とくたに、とくや．．．など、そもそも苗字の読み方は戸籍に登録されとらんのです。読み方は自由でね。あなたが“とくたに”なのは先祖の誰かが決めたことなんでしょう」
	「えー！それも知りませんでした！昔から“とくや”と読み間違えられて生きてきたんですが、変えようと思ったら変えれるんですね」

	名探偵さんは気づいてるかもしれませんが、僕の苗字「徳谷（とくたに）」と同じ地名なんですよね。
	そもそも、この徳谷姓は日本に約８００人しかいないらしく、同姓に出会ったことは過去一度だけ。
	それも繋がりが一切ないのに「同姓、同学年、関西出身の共通項に惹かれたのでお茶しませんか？」とメールで誘ったときだけなんです。
	徳谷智史さん、超立派な方でした。
	そのあたりから徳谷姓のルーツが気になりだしたんです。
	字面以上に珍しい徳谷姓．．．。
	ずっと大阪在住の父親に尋ねたところ「そんなもんは知らん。お前のおじいちゃんとおばあちゃん共に連れ子同士だから、とっくに血は絶えとるわ」という話をされました。
	とっくに絶えとるんかい。

	１５７０年には長宗我部元親公によって再建されたのだとか。
	高知取材はジモコロライター・ヨッピーさんの記事きっかけで訪れたんですが、ヨッピーさんって長宗我部元親の子孫らしいんですよね。
	なにこの偶然感。
	やっぱり何かあるんじゃないの！
	そんな歴史の深い土佐神社（しなねさま）の宮司さんに声をかけたところ．．．
	「あら、徳谷地域について調べてるの？徳谷地域のことなら山本先生が詳しいわよ。いま電話してあげるから、ちょっと待ってね。もしもし？山本先生ですか？突然すみません。徳谷姓の人が徳谷地域の由来について知りたがっているんです。代わってもいいですか？」
	ものすごいスピードで糸口を掴みました。
	どうやら山本先生（８９歳）は、徳谷地域に縁のある方で土地の歴史的背景に精通しているようです。
	行き当たりばったりで訪ねても、玉突き事故みたいにつながっていくのがすごい。
	徳谷姓のルーツを知る人物・山本先生に話を聞いてみた
	「もしもし。突然すみません。徳谷姓と徳谷地域の由来＆関係性について調べているんですが、何かご存知でしょうか？」
	「ああ、そうなんですか。あなたの名前が徳谷なんですか。それは珍しい．．．。私の一族は代々この土地に住んでいて、祖父が村長だったんです。私自身も全国の苗字について調べていたことがあるので。知っていることであればお話しますよ」

	「つ、繋がったー！その徳谷トマトの存在がなければ、高知にルーツがあるかもしれない．．．と思わなかったです」
	「そんな歴史があるからね。これまで住所上は一宮（いっく）で、通称は徳谷地域とややこしいでしょう。特に郵便物がややこしくてね。だから約１７年前に、私が正式名称として登録してもらえるよう掛けあったんですわ。徳谷地域だけ特別扱いするなと当初は反対されたんですが、ゴリ押ししましてね。それで現在の一宮徳谷になったわけです」
	「！！！！山本先生が正式名称に登録していなければ、僕はここに辿りつくことができず、徳谷姓のルーツは分からなかったわけですね。なんて偶然なんだ．．．」
	「ははは、そうかもしれませんね。私も今年で８９歳ですが、徳谷姓の方とお会いしたのは初めてですよ」
	「おお、山本先生初の徳谷になれて光栄です。父親はもちろん、全国の徳谷姓の人がこの事実を知ればすごく喜ぶと思います。ちなみに山本先生の苗字のルーツってなんなんですか？」
	「私は山勘（やまかん）の語源となったといわれている武田信玄の軍師・山本勘助の子孫でね。２００７年のＮＨＫ大河ドラマ『風林火山』の題材になってましたな」
	「最後にすごいルーツの話出てきたー！！」
	まとめ
	・徳谷地域は元々「ケチ谷」と言われていた
	・江戸時代、当時の殿様が猟で訪れて大猟だったため「ケチ谷なんてケチくさい名前は止めて、徳のある徳谷にしろ」と通称が変わった
	・明治の平民苗字必称義務令でこの土地の人たちが「徳谷」姓を名乗ったのではないか
	・その徳谷姓の人たちが時代を経て全国散り散りに移り住んだ（徳谷地域には一人も住んでいない）
	・ちなみに山本先生は、武田信玄の軍師・山本勘助の子孫だった
	・山本先生が徳谷姓のルーツを唯一知る人物！
	・正式住所として徳谷を登録したのも山本先生
	・つまりすごい巡りあわせて徳谷姓のルーツに辿り着いた！
	思いつきで調べ始めた徳谷姓のルーツを探る旅は、たったの半日で運良く辿り着くことができました。
	全国の徳谷姓の人がこの記事を読んでくれれば、数年後、数十年後でも検索して辿り着いてくれれば、山本先生への恩返しにもなるかと思います。
	届け全国約８００人の徳谷へ！

	自分に似合う髪色がいちばん
	このように世界には色々な髪色の人がいます。
	欧米の人からすると、日本人の髪を染める行為が不思議に映るそうです。
	「どうしてキレイな黒髪をわざわざ金髪や茶髪にするの？」と。
	どうやら、日本人がブロンドヘアーなどに憧れているように、欧米の人も日本人の黒髪を評価してくれているようですね。
	髪を染めればそれだけ髪も傷んでしまいます。
	長く豊かな自毛を保持していくには、若い頃に髪で遊びすぎない必要があります。
	それに、最近は流行りの髪色として、黒髪の良さが見直されていますよね。
	一度明るい髪色にしてしまった人でも「髪色戻したい」という衝動にかられるみたいですね。
	そして黒髪のままオシャレを楽めば、それだけ自毛の健康と美しさを保てますよ。

	茶席の作法、これだけ知っておけば安心
	年末年始、訪問先や寺などで抹茶を供されることもあるだろう。

	■茶わん正面避けて飲む
	お茶の心得でよくいわれる「一期一会」。
	今この時間、集う人との関係は二度と同じものはなく、かけがいのないものだという意味だ。
	「亭主のもてなしの心に対して、時間を気にするのは失礼にあたる」（八代さん）ため、着席前に時計は外すのが礼儀だ。
	「時を忘れ、和敬清寂の精神を感じてほしい」（吉田さん）。
	五感で釜のシューッという音を聞き、香を楽しみ、道具を眺め、触って、菓子とお茶を味わう。
	教室に通う女性たちも「身が引き締まり、すがすがしい」などと話す。
	茶席ではお道具拝見も作法の一つ。
	亭主は四季や歳時記、「平和」などのテーマで、道具を客に合わせて用意する。
	これを「しつらえ」という。
	正式の茶席では客の代表の「正客（しょうきゃく）」が亭主の思いをくみ取って、しつらえの意味などを尋ねる。
	「知らないのは恥ではない。どんな茶わんで飲ませてくれているのか、掛物の文字は何と読むかなど尋ねてみてほしい」（八代さん）

	「受刑生活で感じたことは？」
	「よくある刑務所の誤解は？」
	「そのときそのときに自分は何を感じていたのか？」

	それらを「獄中イノシシ日記」と題し、本日から数日にわたって更新していきます！（予定）
	そんな「獄中イノシシ日記」の記念すべき第一話。
	「刑務所って地元の所にいくんでしょ？」とか「窃盗も殺人も同じ部屋なの？」なんて認識方のもいるかと思うので、まずは「刑務所の種類と分類基準について」を簡単に説明していこうかと。
	※色々な資料を元に調べて書いていますが、もし間違いが分かる方いればご指摘お願いします！！

	極端な例でいうと、「出来心で覚せい剤使っちゃいました．．．」って人と「３人殺してます」っていう人が同じ施設に入ることは無いってこと。
	（男であれば！）
	かくいう自分も逮捕当時はかなりビビッており、「めっちゃ極悪で怖い人ばっかりの部屋に入ったらどうしよぅ～．．．」なんて思ってましたね（＾＿＾．）
	このシリーズでは世間一般の方々が抱いてる疑問やよくある誤解、さらには自分が体験した刑務所の内情とそれに対して感じていたこと、等々を記事にしていきたいと思います。

	って感じになるんじゃないかな。
	そうなると、「真面目に怠ける」は不可能だけど、「怠けることに真剣になる」は可能になる。
	例えば、テスト勉強の際に、真面目な人間はとにかく勉強する。
	長い時間かけて、いわゆる正攻法的な手法でもって勉強をする。
	長い時間かけて勉強することは一般的に評価されることだし、結果が出れば「努力が報われた」という感覚を演出することができ、やっぱり評価される。
	しかし一方で、真剣な（この場合は勉強が面倒なので楽をすること、怠けることに、と仮定する）人間はできる限り最小の努力で最大の結果を出そうとする。
	だから、どうやれば楽に良い結果を出せるかを模索する。
	そして、勉強にかける時間は真面目な人間よりもずっと少ない。
	勉強に時間を割かないことは一般的にはよく思われない。
	でも勉強自体は効率的なので、結果はちゃんと出る。
	怠けてる人間がそれなりの結果を出すと、真面目な人間が不憫だから、云われのない非難を受けるかもしれない。
	でも、怠けても（勉強時間が少なくても）結果の出せる人間は真剣に怠けているのだから、本来ならば真面目な人間と同じくらい、評価されてもいいはずなんだけどねぇ。
	ｒｙ
	はい、というわけで、自分は真面目になる気なんてさらさらないが、真剣でありたいなあとか思ったりするわけです。
	特に怠けることとか、楽することとか、好きなものに対して。
	いつも自分で考えて行動して、ちゃんと納得できる結果を出したい。
	人生なんてあっという間なんだから、何事も時間をかけずにこなしたい。
	ギターだって最小の努力で最大の結果を出せれば上達は早いでしょ？
	なんか、この記事書いてると、真面目って侮蔑の言葉なんじゃないかって気がしてきた。
	真面目系クズとか、もはや二重にディスられてるじゃん、みたいな。
	ああ～最後の最後で毒を吐いてしまった．．．

	疫病はどの野菜にも発生しますが、実は野菜の科目によって菌の種類が異なっています。
	適切な薬剤を選ぶようにしましょう。
	疫病を防ぐ予防と対策は？
	疫病にかかった抜いた苗は必ず畑の外で処分しましょう。
	畑やプランターの水はけを良くすることが疫病を予防できます。
	過剰な元肥や追肥は避け過繁茂にならないようにしましょう。
	ポリマルチなどで灌水時の泥はねを防止しましょう。
	接ぎ木苗など疫病に抵抗性のある苗を利用することで発病をある程度は防ぶことが出来ます。
	連作や輪作は避けるようにすることで疫病を予防できます。
	収穫後の土中の株は疫病菌の越冬場所となるので必ず除去しましょう。
	疫病を農薬を使わずに治療するには？
	薬剤を使わずに疫病を治療するのは難しいのですが、疫病が発生した株は発症部分を切り取り畑の外に持ち出して処分しましょう。
	その後、発生を抑制する為に土壌と畑の状態を見直し再発を防ぎます。
	疫病が茎に発病した場合は、株ごと処分するか薬剤治療をするしか手立てはありません。
	薬剤を使用したくない方は、疫病になる前に予防と対策をしっかりと行っておくことが大切です。

	こうした流れが循環していけば、「金はいいから休みが欲しい」という現場の声にも応えていけるようになる。
	「飲食店でパート・アルバイトのシフトを回すように、大人数を抱えて適正な業務量で現場を動かしていくことが可能になれば離職防止にもなります」
	ここ数年来、賃金上昇によって人材募集を続けてきた状況は早期に落ち着くのではないか、と香月氏は予測している。

	建築費高騰が抑制され、新規物件の着工が検討しやすくなるようになる潮目の時期は意外と近いのかもしれない。

	もはや金では動かない人材．．．．．．建設業界の悲鳴
	「建設業界のクライアントからは、人材不足によってここ２、３年ずっと悲鳴に近い声が聞こえてきています。特に採用難易度の高い施工管理技師などの有資格者は、給料を上げてもなかなか集まりません」
	そう話すのは、大手人材サービス会社で都内の建設業関連企業を中心に担当する営業マンの香月友和さん（仮名）。
	公共工事を直請けする大手・中堅のゼネコンから、下請けで専門工事を行う地場の会社まで４０社程度のクライアントを抱え、求人媒体を利用した採用活動の提案を行っている。

	若年層ではなく中高年層が働き手として求められている
	人材難の大きな要因は、これまで現場の中心であった２０～３０代の若年層が建設業界の仕事に足を踏み入れることをためらっているからだという。
	「現状の忙しさは皆分かっているし、その要因がオリンピックに向けた大きな流れの中であることも分かっているので、“待遇が安定しているのは今だけ”と考える人が多いようです。確かに資格取得や技能経験を積んでも、５年後に仕事がなくなる可能性があるようでは躊躇してしまいますよね」
	そのため、香月さんが担当するクライアントの中では４０代～５０代をターゲットに採用活動の方針転換を進めている企業も多いという。
	「２０２０年以降も安定した受注が見込める理由をアピールして、定年まで働きたいと考える中高年を狙っている求人が増えています。また大手ゼネコンでは定年した従業員を再雇用する動きも進んでいます。自社の業務への理解が深く、年齢的に働ける期間は需要がピークとなる向こう数年間だけ。企業と働く人双方にとってメリットがあるやり方だと思いますね」
	新規着工を検討できる潮目の時期は近い？

	特に公共工事は申請書類の事務処理にかかる時間も膨大で、現場を統括する施工管理技士が現場に出られず、事務所に縛り付けられるような事態も発生しているそうだ。

	それと、これは、見た目というか
	毅然とした態度
	を示すというか・・・・まず、前出のゴールキック、コーナーキックもですが
	間接フリーキックの時の手を上に上げる時や、ファウルの時攻める側を指し示すときなどの手まっすぐのばそう！！！
	肘を曲げて、いると、何か自信のない、威厳のない雰囲気に。
	笛の音が、「ピー」ではなく「ヒョロヒョロ」となっているのと同じように感じる。
	ほんとにちょっとしたことなのだけど。
	こういうことをちょっと変えるだけで、取り組み方も
	そしてなにより、選手やベンチなどの受けとる側もちょっと「変わる」
	気持ちのいい審判に笛を吹いてもらうと、ジャッジを素直に受け入れるし、
	試合が・・・・気持ちのいいものになるのですよ・・・・・・
	そうすれば、主審も「余裕の笑顔」がでてくる。
	４級でもチャレンジしてみよう。

	でも、もしこれを、あなたが無意識に相手に対して行ってしまっていたら、、、、怖いですよね。
	だから、こうしましょう。
	相手をほめる
	たったこれだけで、人間関係は驚くほど好転します。
	なんだよ、へりくだって、相手にごまをすれって事かよ！などと勘違いせずにしっかりと聞いてください、下心を持って相手に何かしてもらう為にほめるのではなく、相手の良い部分を探して、相手が気を使っている部分を見つけて、それを口に出してほめてあげるんです。
	人間１００％カッコいい、１００％完璧なひとなんて誰ひとり存在しません。
	私もそうですし、これを読んでいるあなたもそうです、良いところがあれば、必ず悪いところもあります。
	ひとあらを探して突くのは簡単ですが、突いたひと意外は誰も良い気持ちになりませんし、誰も得しません。
	でも、良い部分を探してほめてあげれば、ほめられたひとは嬉しくなって、もっとがんばるでしょうし、ほめた本人だって、ちょっといい気持ちになっているもの。

	理由３：怒られても、けなされても成長できるひとは、あなたのことを必要としていない。
	出来ないから罵倒する、失敗したから責め立てる。
	仕事などでしかたの無い時もありますが、それは本当にそのひとの事を考えて行こなっている事でしょうか？あなた自身の保身の為だったり、ストレス発散、誰かを踏みつけること、ひとを上から見下ろす事の優越感に浸っているだけ、、、ということはありませんか？
	怒られている人、虐げられているひとは、口にはださなくても、相手が本当はどんな気持ちで、そんな行為行動を行っているのか、案外気がついているもの。
	つまらない優越感の為にひとを誹謗中傷したり、踏みにじるのは、悲しいだけですから、もう終わりにしましょう。
	罵倒されて、成長するひと、踏みにじられて成長するひとは、あなたに言われなくてもひとりで成長できます。
	だって、それに負けないエネルギーを持っているのですから。
	そしてその人が成長した時には、あなたはもう必要ないと思われるでしょう、もしあなただけが「２人は良い関係だ」と勘違いしていたら、そのひとは確実にあなたのもとを去っていきます。
	では、ほめて相手が成長した場合はどうかというと、仕事・恋愛・プライベートでも、きっと良い関係になっているはず、成長したからあなたは必要なくなる？そんな訳ありませんよね。
	ほら、ほめ上手になると、生活が凄く充実していくのがわかりますよね。
	では、次はどうすれば相手の良いところを見つけて、ほめ上手になり、人間関係を劇的に改善できるかについて話を進めます。

	ピコ太郎の大ヒット曲「Ｐｅｎ－Ｐｉｎｅａｐｐｌｅ－Ａｐｐｌｅ－Ｐｅｎ（ＰＰＡＰ）」を、無関係の会社が商標出願していることが問題になっている。
	これによってピコ太郎はＰＰＡＰが使えなくなってしまうのだろうか？
	ハフィントンポストでは、登録を担当している特許庁に聞いてみた。
	すると、担当者は一般論として、「著名な名称で出願があった場合、承諾の有無などが審査の対象となる」と話した。

	今回の問題では、大阪府の無関係の企業が２０１６年から２０１７年にかけ、ピコ太郎の所属するエイベックス側よりも前に、「ＰＰＡＰ」「ペンパイナッポーアッポーペン」など計７件を申請した。
	特許庁によると、手数料が支払われておらず、いずれも審査待ちとなっている。
	一方、エイベックス側は、「ＰＰＡＰ」のみ出願している。
	商標登録制度では、先に出願した人に商標権を与える先願主義を採用。
	出願した順番で審査するため、「ＰＰＡＰ」も先に出願した大阪府の会社の結果が出ない限り、エイベックス側の審査は始まらない。
	特許庁によると、近年一部の出願者が他人の商標を先取って申請し、手数料を支払わない事例が横行。
	特許庁は、こうした出願を一旦は受け付けるが、支払いの意思がないことを確認して却下処分を行っており、ホームページ上で注意喚起している。
	こうした事態にピコ太郎本人も困惑。
	日本テレビの情報番組「スッキリ！！」の中で、「世の中でいろんなことがある」と答えていた。
	ＰＰＡＰが使えなくなるのではと取り沙汰されたが、ピコ太郎側が承諾していなければ、そうした事態にはならなさそうだ。

	遺伝子はどんな働きをするのか？
	それでは、初めに生体内での遺伝子の働き、そして何からできているのか調べていきましょう。
	まず、遺伝子の働きについて説明していきます。
	遺伝子の中には、細胞を作る材料であり、細胞が活動する上で最も重要な働きをするタンパク質を作るための情報が蓄えられています。
	このため、遺伝子の構造や構成が変化すると、生物の構造と機能に変異を生じることになるのです。
	「突然変異」という言葉を聞いたことはありませんか？
	これは、遺伝子の構造が突然変化することによって、通常とは異なるタンパク質できることを意味します。

	つまり、ＤＮＡ配列を解析するということは、ある生物のＤＮＡ上で、どのような塩基配列になっているかを解析しているのです。
	そしてこの塩基配列が持つ意味を遺伝情報といいます。
	遺伝子は、何百万個とＡＴＧＣが並んでいるＤＮＡ上の一部に存在します。
	そのため、我々がどのような遺伝子を持っているのか？という問題を解くためには、まず、ＤＮＡ配列を解析し、ＡＴＧＣがどのような並び方をしているかという情報を得る必要があるのです。
	その後、ＤＮＡ上のどの部分に遺伝子がコードされているのか（情報があるか）ということを発見していかなくてはいけません。
	この「遺伝子って？」の項の最初でいった、遺伝子の構造が変化するというのは、この「ＡＴＧＣ」の並び方が通常と異なってしまう状態のことをいいます。
	「突然変異」などもこの「ＡＴＧＣ」の並び方が異なることで生じる変化のことです。
	このように、ＤＮＡ配列、つまり「ＡＴＧＣ」の並び方によって、生物種としての情報や生命活動が決定されています。
	そのため、「ＤＮＡは生命の青写真」などと表現されることもあります。

	資金は１００万円くらい
	まず気になるのはお金ですよね。
	安いといってもどれくらいかかるのでしょうか。
	と言ってもやっぱりピンキリで、いくらでもお金をかけて店舗にこだわる事は出来ますが、やはりオススメしたいのは資金をかけない事。
	一般的なお店だと場所（立地）や内装、外装にこだわりますけど、ラーメン屋に関しては「お金をかければ売れる」という考え方とはまた違います。
	いきなり都内に出すのはリスキーだし、「場所が良ければ人が来る」＝「家賃の分売り上げないといけない」ということになります。
	なので初めは居抜き物件で家賃５万円前後で探しましょう。
	『居抜き物件とは？』
	設備、機材はそのまま使わせて貰えるような条件の物件だとかなり安く済みます。
	そして機材やテーブルや椅子、看板にもお金をかける必要がないですね。
	高級感だしてもなんか浮いちゃいます。
	それなら逆に手作りしちゃったほうが安く済むし雰囲気も出ますよね。

	資格は特に必要なし
	飲食店だし「調理師免許」的なものが必要って思う人も多いですけど実際免許は必要なく誰でも出来ます。
	厳密にいうなら「食品衛生管理者」を取る必要はありますけど１万円払って１日講習受けるだけのカンタンな作業です。
	まぁつまり「ラーメン屋やりたい」と思ったらすぐに出来ます！
	数年の厳しい修行も今では必要なし！
	ラーメン屋って言ったらまず想像するのが長い修行の日々。
	太ったヒゲの強面店長に殴られ怒鳴られながら３、４年修行してやっと作れる１杯のラーメン・・・。
	と、そんな時代はもう終わりました。
	また、毎日自宅で研究しながらラーメン作りに励む。
	そんな努力も今や必要ありません。
	なぜなら・・・
	繁盛店のレシピ公開されてますから！残念！！
	麺屋武蔵や大勝軒など有名店のレシピ→有名店のラーメンレシピ
	本もたくさん出ちゃってる→旭屋出版
	というか家で作れちゃう→クックパット
	レシピがあれば修行しなくても誰でも作れちゃいますよね。
	そして既に繁盛済みの言わば「成功したラーメン」を参考に自分でアレンジを加えちゃえば商品として完成するわけです。
	オリジナルのラーメンで勝負したいという気持ちもわかりますがそれをやるには既に流通しきってしまっています。
	今から音楽業界に参入するときに「流行り物は嫌だから」とまったく新しいジャンルで勝負しますか？
	奇を衒いすぎてなかなか受け入れられるのに時間がかかってしまいますよね。
	まったく新しい誰も見たことのないラーメンを開発するところから始めるのもありだと思いますが、定番なラーメン、王道なラーメンに自分の個性をプラスした隙間産業を狙うのもありですね。
	ラーメンを食べに行く人は頭の中にある程度のラーメン像を描いてしまっていますし、アイデア商品というのはブレイクしたとしても長く続かないリスクもあります。
	儲かるラーメン屋とは
	さてさて、なかなか簡単に開業することは出来そうですけど実際には儲かるのかどうかですよね。
	ここでも儲かるために必要なコト。
	紹介していきまっす！

	経営者なら、目の前でお客さん（お金）を逃すのを黙ってみてられませんよね。
	イケル！と思い店を増やすという判断をするのは間違ってはいないように思えます。
	時代の先読みなんて誰にも出来ませんし、リスクを恐れていては何も出来ません。
	しかしブームはいつか去るということを頭にいれておかないといけません。
	ラーメン屋開業まとめ
	個人的にぼくもラーメン屋の開業を志したことがあります。
	もちろん立派な理念があったわけじゃなく「男ならラーメン屋」みたいな気持ちだったんです。
	そういうのありますよね！？
	しかし、調べるほど現実にぶち当たりました。

	まぁ「これから同じラーメンばかりを毎日毎日数十年作り続けるんだ」といわれたらちょっと気が引けちゃいますけど、
	ノレン分け出来るくらい有名になったり、フランチャイズ化出来るほどのノウハウを身につけられれば、ラーメン屋で楽して稼ぐなんて生活も送れるのかもしれません。
	しかしなにより「好きだからやりたい」という動機に対して気軽に始められるラーメン屋。
	「思い立ったら挑戦して細かいことは後で考えたらいい！」
	と成功者の方達も申しておりましたし！

	つまり、そこら中にあるわけですから「美味い」は当たり前。
	よく「おれラーメン好きだし、ここより美味いラーメン作れるわ」という安易な動機で開業を目指す人も多いですが、そこら辺にあるような「ただ美味い」だけのお店を出しても来店動機にはなりづらいという事です。
	「じゃぁもう今更ラーメン屋なんてムリじゃんか！」
	と思うのはまだ早い。
	こういった流通しきった市場では「スキマ産業」を狙って行くことでまだまだ繁盛させることが出来ます。
	「こんなお店があったらいいのに」というような不便や不満を解決したスキマ産業で成功した例をいくつか紹介します。

	「今のように紛争後の状況では、学校が非常に重要な役割を果たします」と、ユニセフのチャンタル・カピンガ・ゼンバ教育専門官が語ります。
	「子どもたちが再び学校に通えるようになったということは、すべてにおいて、平和が戻ってきたという象徴なのです。それ以上に、学校は、共存への道を学ぶ機会を提供しています」
	平和的に共存するために
	ジャネットさんと地域の子どもたち。
	あらゆる人を受け入れ、調和的な生活を営むことができる能力は、まさに「平和のための学習プログラム」でユニセフが力を注いでいることです。
	このプログラムは、ユニセフ、オランダ政府、参加国の政府、そのほかの重要なパートナーの協力のもと実施されています。
	このイニシアチブは、紛争の危険がある地域や紛争後の復興段階にある地域を含め、紛争の影響を受ける地域のレジリエンス（回復力）や社会的統合、人間の安全保障の強化のために開始されました。
	特に、平和のための学習プログラムは、平和構築のための教育に関する政策や実施の強化を目指しています。
	「勉強だけでなく、子どもたちが自らの可能性を高め、平和に共存できるようにする力を身につけてほしいです」と、ゼンバ教育専門官が話します。
	学校でプログラムを行うことで、さまざまなレベルのコミュニティの人々に影響をもたらすことができます。
	まず、研修を受けた教員は、学校内で社会的統合を促進させる活動を率いていくことができます。
	研修を受けた教員の下で学習する子どもたちは、平和委員会に入ったり、コミュニティでの認識を高めるためのスポーツイベントや話し合い、劇を企画することで、平和をもたらす当事者になるのです。
	１０代の若者たちも、若者クラブで自分の意見を発表したり、活動を企画したりする機会を手にすることができます。
	学校は、異なる民族の人たちが一緒に集まる場所としての重要な役割も果たします。
	「子どもたちが一緒に遊んでいる姿を目することで、以前は特にＰＴＡや地域の活動で顔を合わせてもお互いに無視をしたり、交流を避けていた親たちも、相互理解をしていくのです」と、ムヒヤ校長先生が語ります。

	「村が襲撃され、焼かれてしまいました。家族全員、避難しなくてはいけませんでした」と、ジャネットさんが語ります。
	「数日間歩き続けて、避難民キャンプに身を寄せるようになりました。しかし、そこも襲撃され、放火されてしまいました。それから、ニュンズ市にある古い倉庫に身を隠しました」
	数週間、報復を恐れた１万５０００人以上の人々が倉庫に身を隠していました。
	そのほとんどが、女性や子どもたちです。
	現地当局による仲介により、戦闘は終わりを迎えました。

	しかしその後も多くの避難民は自宅に戻ることができませんでした。
	「現地当局は、避難民の人たちが再び畑で仕事をし、日常の生活を送ることができるようにするため、村に再定住させることを決定しました」と、ニュンズ２区教育省行政区長のデルピン・ワンゲ・ビン・プングさんが語ります。
	「ピグミー族とバンツー族は、常に密な相互依存の関係にあります。ほとんどのケースで、ピグミー族がバンツー族に雇われて仕事をしています。しかし、ピグミー族は社会から疎外され、土地や学校などの基本的な社会サービスへのアクセスが限られていることがよくあります」と、プングさんが話します。
	「この差別が地域の緊張の源となっており、わずかな火種がこのような状況にまで悪化してしまうことがあるのです」
	学校に通う子どもたちの姿は、平和の象徴
	ユニセフの支援のもと、政府は村の学校の再開に優先的に力を入れました。
	「いくつかの学校は紛争下で荒され、放火されました。そして、多くの先生が避難していきました」と、ゴンベ・ワナの学校のガストン・ムグンガ・ムヒヤ校長先生が語りました。
	「両親に子どもたちを再び学校に通わせるように伝えるため、戸別訪問の啓発活動キャンペーンも実施しました」

	種の識別は動物の場合には個体の形態に差があることで行われる。
	雌雄は形態差があっても同種である。
	どの程度の差があると別種とするのかは経験によってなされていることが多く普遍的な原則はない。
	ただし形態差の程度は生殖隔離の差に応じて違っている場合が多いと考えられている。
	繁殖可能な子が生まれるようであれば同種である。
	異なる種を交配して生まれた種は不妊である。
	例えばライオンとジャガーを交配して生まれたライガーには子供ができない。
	したがってライオンとジャガーは別種とする。
	ゲノム分析が可能になってゲノム差が大きく形態差がなくても別種とすべき隠蔽種の発見もある。

	たとえば生物学者は伝統的に鳥類と爬虫類を別の綱に分類してきた。
	しかし分岐分類では鳥とワニがひとつのクレードをつくった。
	そしてトカゲとヘビがもうひとつの別のクレードをつくった。
	単独のクレードをつくるためにはワニがトカゲやヘビと祖先を共有するまでさかのぼって爬虫綱に鳥類も含める必要がある。
	ゲノム分析の結果は分岐分類の正しさを立証することが多くなってきた。
	ただし分岐分類をする場合には適切な外群を設定しないと系統推定は大きく誤った結果を出してしまうことが予想できる。
	【系統間の距離の推定】
	比較する動物群の系統の順序は分岐点を決めることで定まる。
	それでは系統間の距離はどう推定できるだろうか。
	系統間の距離はある程度分岐からの時間を反映したものであることが望ましい。
	生物体内に進化の時間を刻む時計がありしかも時計の速さが共通であれば理想的である。
	残念ながらそれほど理想的な進化時計はない。
	しかし分子時計があった。
	遺伝子突然変異がほぼ一定の速さで起こるということが分かったのである。
	遺伝子突然変異が起こっても翻訳されるアミノ酸を変えずタンパク質が変化しない場合もある。
	逆に重大な突然変異が起こればその個体は死んでしまって証拠が残らない。
	遺伝子突然変異ばかりでなく染色体突然変異も起こるだろう。
	したがって分子時計にはいろいろなノイズ（邪魔もの）が入る。
	それでも分岐点からの距離を表すのには有用であった。

	生物の多様性
	この地球上には体のつくりや生活のしかたが異なるさまざまな生物がいる。
	この章ではこのような多様な生物を分類する方法と生物の進化の道すじや類縁関係（系統）を調べる方法を学ぼう。
	啓林館の主に平成６年度版の『生物ＩＩ』より引用した。
	新編集で画期的な教科書だった。
	進化メーリングリスト［ＥＶＯＬＶＥ］と岩波書店の雑誌『科学』で進化の教科書が話題になったことがあります（１９９７年２月）そのときの意見を紹介します。

	生物の種は変化し続け新しい種が生じ古い他の種が絶滅していくという現代的な種の考え方はダーウィンが『種の起源』を著した以後と考えられる。
	生物が進化してきた経路が系統であり、この経路を推定し、それから示される生物の類縁関係にもとずいて分類するのが系統分類である。
	現在では、系統分類が真の自然分類であると考えられている。
	『種の起源』第１３章に、ダーウィンの系統分類の考えが示されている。
	『種の起源』に唯一含まれている分岐の概念の図を参考にしながら、ダーウィンは多くの遺伝形質を共有しているものから、属、亜科、科というふうに統合されていくのが自然だと記述している。
	しかし、形質が似ているからといって祖先が共通とは限らない。
	ダーウィンが「適応形質」ないしは「相似形質」と呼ぶ類似があるからだ。
	いわゆる「相同な形質」こそ重視されなければならない。
	そこで「痕跡器官」の重要性が増すことになる。
	痕跡器官は、適応的な意味は小さくとも、進化的な意味は大きいからである（ダーウィンの用語では「変化に伴う由来」）。
	ダーウィンは形質を考察するときの注意点まであげている（光文社古典文庫『種の起源（下）』２８５－）。

	Ｐｙｔｈｏｎを学ぶか、Ｐｅｒｌを学ぶか、Ｒｕｂｙを学ぶか、と考えた時に、日本人だしＲｕｂｙに一番親近感が湧くなと思ったら手を出すと良いかも。
	Ｒａｉｌｓ系の仕事はポツポツあるので、周囲で最近そういう案件見かけるなぁと感じた人は学んでおくと仕事の足しになるかも。
	言語の硬度を測定すると、Ｊａｖａは硬度８くらい、Ｐｙｔｈｏｎは６くらいになるのに対して、Ｒｕｂｙは３くらいになる。
	柔らかい手触りが好きだなと思う人はＲｕｂｙを学ぶといいかも。

	これからプログラムを学びたいという人で、Ｗｅｂ系を考えている人はとりあえずＰＨＰから始めると手っ取り早いかもしれない（もちろんその前にＨＴＭＬは覚えておく必要はある）。
	逆にＷｅｂ系以外（データ処理、ＧＵＩプログラム等）に手を出したいと思っている人にとっては、検討する必要がまったくない言語である。
	既にいくつか言語を学んだことがある人なら学習にそれほど手間取ることはないはずなので、必要になった時に学ぶくらいのスタンスで良いかもしれない。

	前書き
	この世にはたくさんのプログラミング言語が存在します。
	Ｗｉｋｉｅｐｄｉａのプログラミング言語一覧を見ると、実に２００個以上というわけの分からない数の言語が並んでいたりします。
	２００の中にはほとんど使われてない言語も混じってるので、実際に仕事でざくざく使われている言語は２０とか３０とかそういうオーダーなのですが、それでも１人の人間が把握するにはちょっと多過ぎる数です。
	本記事では、そうした有り余るプログラミング言語の海の中で「どれを勉強したらいいの？」とか「どれを採用するのが適切？」という悩みをお持ちの方が「よし、この言語に決めた！」と自信を持って決断できるように背中を押すことを目的として書かれました。
	無責任に背中をドンと押すことが目的なので、これを読めば正しい判断ができるかという点についてはノーコメントとさせていただきます。
	使ってみないと過ちには気付けないものさ。

	軽い言語だと勝手に裏側でやってくれるようなメモリの確保とかファイルポインタの操作なんかも、Ｃでは自分で意識して書かないといけない。
	ので、一度触れておくとプログラムが裏側で何をしているかが意識できて良いかもしれない。
	ＯＳや言語の細かい挙動を追いたいという願望が生まれた時に（たとえばＰＨＰのネットワーク関連の機能について、実際にこれは裏では何をしてるんだ、ということが知りたくなった時とか）、Ｃが読めると割とあっさり答えに辿りつけたりもする。
	ガリガリ書けるようになる必要があるかは別として、とりあえず知っておいて損はない言語。

	職場で昔のＰｅｒｌのソースをメンテする必要に迫られるというシチュエーションはけっこうあるので、さらっと読める程度は学んでおいた方が良いかもしれない。
	これから学ぶのであれば、まずどのバージョンを学ぶのかから考える必要がある。
	新しくＰｅｒｌ６（ＲａｋｕｄｏＳｔａｒ）が用意されつつあるけど、Ｐｅｒｌ５と比べるとだいぶ違う言語になっている。
	レガシーなＰｅｒｌを触る必要性を意識して学ぶならＰｅｒｌ５を、新しいＰｅｒｌってどんなものだろうと探究心から学ぶならＰｅｒｌ６を手にとれば良いんじゃないだろうか。

	間違っても「ちょっとプログラムというのを学んでみたい。Ｃ＋＋ってかっこよさそう」なんていう気持ちで手をつけてはいけない。
	「ちょっと登山を経験してみよっかな」と言ってチョモランマに登るようなものである。
	悪いことは言わないので高尾山（ＰＨＰとかＪａｖａＳｃｒｉｐｔ）あたりから初めておこう。
	速くて省メモリな○○ライブラリというような触れ込みで公開されるライブラリはＣ＋＋で書かれていることが多い。
	たとえば去年（２０１０年）Ｇｏｏｇｌｅが公開したＲＥ２という速くて省メモリな正規表現ライブラリはＣ＋＋で書かれていた。
	そういう良く呼び出され、速度が求められ、書き捨てられるようなコードではない系のソフトを作りたい人は甘えたことは言わずにＣ＋＋に手を出すのが良いかもしれない。

	田んぼ・畑を売却したい！
	一般的に不動産の売買は不動産の引渡しと登記によって完了しますが、農地の場合は購入や売却に際して農業委員会や都道府県知事の許可が必要です。
	売主が農地の購入や売却申請手続きを行い、農業委員会や都道府県知事の許可を得て、始めて売買できることになるのです。
	※許可なしに売買をした場合には契約は無効になります。

	ペリカン限定・自分でやるペン先交換
	ペリカン・ペン先ユニット
	生活舎の万年筆では、『ペリカンのスーべレーンシリーズを使っているが、いまの胴軸を活用してペン先のサイズを太くしたい（細くしたい）』または『ペン先を落として曲げてしまった。
	生活舎でペン先だけを販売してもらえないだろうか』というご要望にお応えします。
	生活舎では、ペン先ユニット（ペン先とペン芯のソケットの一体型）をご購入いただきご自身でペン先交換を行えるよう、ペリカン・スーベレーンＭ３００～Ｍ１０００、９００トレドと７００トレド万年筆商品に限定したうえで、正しいペン先の交換方法の開示とペン先（ペン先とペン芯の一体型）の販売を試験的に行っています。
	＜ご注意：ただし、過去９７年以降に新品としてご購入いただいたペンに限定します。
	それ以前の旧型はネジ切り部分の長さが、現行のペン芯とは異なる場合があるからです。
	まずは、以下でご説明する『正しいペン先の外し方』をよくお読みいただき、ご自身でお試しください。
	なお、以下に記述するペン先の外し方および装着方法は、あくまでペリカンの万年筆に特化した機能ですので、ペリカン以外の万年筆で試みることはできませんので、予めご了承ください。
	新しいペン先のご購入については、ペリカンのペン先ユニットご注文ページをご用意しましたので、そちらからご注文をお願いします。

	“観賞用の菊を栽培していたときは、もっとずっと穏やかな花で、すぐアブラ虫がついて、その対策に大わらわだったけれど、高橋剛さんのご指導を受け、土にボカシ肥を混ぜて、食用菊「もってのほか」を育てるようになったら、無農薬でも虫も全くつかず、菊が荒々しく咲き誇るようになった”そうです。
	遠田さんの丹精こめた「もってのほか」は、すべて「バランスアルファ」の材料として、完全無農薬・無化学肥料で栽培されており、外側の緑色のガクもいっしょに摘み取られて、そのまま玄米等といっしょに醗酵させます。

	ＮＩＳＡ口座の期間が終了すると実際は損失なのに課税される
	ＮＩＳＡ口座で投資したがゆえに、損失が出ていても課税されてしまうリスクがあるのだ。
	向いてそうで不向きな高リターン狙いの商品
	ついつい「売却益が非課税なので、ＮＩＳＡでは高リターンを狙える商品を買おう」と考えがちだ。
	しかし、高いリターンが望める商品は当然、高リスクで裏目に出れば大きなマイナスになる。
	値下がりに弱いＮＩＳＡ向きとは言いがたい。
	それでも高リスクの株式投資で高リターンを狙いたい投資家もいるだろう。
	その場合、個別株ではなく株式投信の、積み立て投資が選択肢となる。
	売買タイミングを分散することでリスクを下げることができ、ＮＩＳＡ向けの中リスク・中リターン投資に近づけることができるからだ。

	しかも、モンテネグロ国内には日本大使館はなく、お隣のセルビアの日本大使館が兼務しているため、パスポートの再発行などの手続きには、通常以上に時間や手間がかかります。
	くれぐれもパスポートだけは失くさない、盗まれないようにご注意ください！
	※万が一パスポートの盗難被害に遭ってしまった際は、帰国するためにパスポートの再発行の手続きを速やかに行う必要があります。
	パスポートの再発行の手順については「【クロアチア治安情報】旅行中スリ・盗難に遭ったらどうする？」をご参照ください（モンテネグロでもクロアチア語が問題なく通じるので、記事内で紹介しているクロアチア語フレーズがそのまま通じます）。
	パスポート再発行の手続きも、必要書類などクロアチアのものとほとんど同じです。
	スリをする相手もプロ、ターゲットとなる人物をしっかりと品定めしています。
	混雑したバスなどの車内はもちろん、散策中も貴重品には常に気を配りましょう。
	スリのターゲットになりやすい人の特徴を学んで、標的にならないようにしっかりと対策をしてくださいね。

	「今度クルーズ旅行でモンテネグロのコトルに立ち寄る予定なのですが、治安はどうですか？」「ドブロブニクから日帰りでモンテネグロのコトルに行こうと思っているのですが、ひとり旅でも安全ですか？」このようなご質問を時折頂戴します。
	日本では「どんな国か全く想像がつかない」という方がほとんどのモンテネグロ。
	治安面が心配になるのは自然なことですよね。
	ですが、モンテネグロは隣国のクロアチアと同じく、安心して旅を楽しめる平和な国。
	海外旅行ではつい気持ちが大きくなってしまいますが、普段日本で気を付けていることを守り、夜道や人気のない場所を歩かないなど、常識的な行動をすれば危険な目に遭うこともほとんどありません。
	あくまでも個人的な体験ではありますが、筆者も女性ひとりでモンテネグロを訪れたことがありますが、身の危険を感じたり、怖い体験を一度もしたことがありません。
	そんな平和なモンテネグロですが、やはり油断は禁物です。

	ビーチに貴重品を持っていかない
	アドリア海が美しいモンテネグロ。
	「せっかく夏に来たのだから、アドリア海で泳ぎたい！」という方もいらっしゃると思います。
	ビーチに行く際はお財布やカメラ、スマホなどの貴重品は、できるだけ持って行かないようにしましょう。
	とくに一人旅の際は要注意。
	ビーチを離れて海で泳いでいる間に盗まれてしまう可能性があります。
	海水浴に行く際は、最低限のお金、荷物だけを持って行くようにしてくださいね。
	支払い内容を必ず確認する
	特にコトルなどの観光地のレストランではお勘定時にレシート（支払い内容）をしっかりと確認しましょう。
	これはモンテネグロに限った話ではありませんが、「食べていないはずの料理や、飲んでいないはずのドリンクがお勘定に入っていた」なんてことがしばしば起こり得ます。
	「何かおかしい」と思ったら、すぐにその場で伝えましょう。
	もちろん悪意なくミスをしまった可能性もありますが、なかには故意に割り増し料金を請求をする悪質なウェイターもいるので、毎回しっかりと確認を行ってくださいね。
	以上を頭の片隅に置いて、モンテネグロ旅行を安全に楽しんでくださいね！

	おわりに
	どの食用油でも、基本的には同じことがいえます。
	ただ、油は少量でも高カロリーなので、摂取のし過ぎには注意しましょう。
	また、私たちが普段料理に使っている量も実は摂取のし過ぎということも多いので、自分の食事を一度見直してみるのはいかがでしょうか。

	キャノーラ油
	菜種油のひとつで、キャノーラというアブラナ科の植物を原料とした油です。
	キャノーラ油はカナダで開発されて付けられた名前なので、菜種油とは厳密には同じではありません。

	今では雑貨屋さんや１００均といったお店にも売っていますが、人工香料等を使っている場合がありますので、不安な方はアロマ専用のお店に行かれるのが安心して良い香りと巡り会えるかと思います！
	２．楽しみ方は、インテリアｏｒゆらめきの２パターン
	キャンドルですが、火を灯さなくてもオイルの香りがあるのでインテリアとしても可愛い物が多いので見て香って楽しめることが出来ます。
	しばらくインテリアとして楽しめば香りが残っているうちに火を灯して使ってみましょう。
	ただ飾っているとどうしてもホコリがたまるので火を付ける前には必ずキレイに拭き取りましょう。
	お部屋のフレグランスに使われているのもよく見かけますが、家やお店でアロマの香りが漂ってくると自分だけでなくお客様にも優雅な時間を共に過ごすことが出来るので、心身共にリラックス出来ます。
	また、リラックスだけでなくアイディア力や企画力がＵＰされますよ！
	インテリアとしても最高ですが、キャンドルの灯りは心臓の鼓動と同じリズムを持つユラメキ。
	『１／ｆゆらぎ』なのでリラックスできると言われていますので、ぜひ火を灯してユラメキを体験してみて下さい。
	３．キャンドルの灯し方のコツ

	７．癒された後は、火の始末を。
	使うに当たっての１番重要な事です。
	火の始末です！使う時間帯にもよりますが、多いのは寝る前に付けてそのまま寝てしまったという話をよく聞きますがこれは危険です。
	１時間程度灯した後必ず火を消してから就寝またはお出かけして下さい。
	不安な方にアロマキャンドルは、お部屋だけでなくお風呂でも使っていただけます。
	湯船につかり電気を消してアロマキャンドルをつけるとあたたかい蒸気とともに良い香りも充満し普段のお風呂とはひと味もふた味も違って入っていただけると思います。
	入浴剤でも香りは取り込めますが、部屋の空気の香りだと身体全体が包み込まれているようで、気持ちよくはいれます。
	湯船に浮かべるキャンドルもあるので火の始末には安心して使えます！
	これらの注意を心がけながら心身共に健やかな時間を過ごすことが出来るアロマキャンドルを是非、未体験の方にもお試しできるかと思います。
	このストレス社会から少しの時間でも逃避できるんじゃないかなと感じています。
	自分に合った香り探しから始まり、その日の気分や体調に合わせて精油を変えることのできるちょっとした贅沢なじぶんだけの時間を作ってみてはいかがでしょうか！
	キャンドルからは、マイナスイオンが放出されていますが２００００個／ｃｍといわれていて自宅にいながら森林浴効果です！相乗効果として、キャンドルをつける際には白熱灯の間接照明がよりリラックスできます。
	エステやスパももちろんいいですが、自宅で気軽に出来るアロマキャンドルは現代の必需品といっても過言ではないかと思います♪

	なぜ銀閣寺を建てたのか
	足利義政は文明５年には息子に将軍の地位を譲っていたのです。
	その９年後、銀閣寺の建設が始まります。
	実は先代の真似事だった
	３代将軍足利義満が金閣寺を建てていますが、
	この銀閣寺はそれを真似て作ったと言われています。
	もともと、義満も隠居の為に金閣寺を保有していたそうですが、
	この銀閣寺も隠居の為に作られたのです。
	完成を待てずに住んでしまう子供っぷり
	すみません、子供っぷりは私個人のイメージです。
	銀閣寺の建設を始めたのは、文明１４年（１４８２年）ですが、
	その翌年、文明１５年にはもう銀閣寺に住んでいたという記録があるそうです。
	完成には８年の歳月が費やされたとなっているのに、
	着工から１年後には住み始めてしまうという、
	かなりの前ノリだったのが分かります。
	それだけ隠居したかったのでしょう。
	住み始めてからは、お茶を楽しんだり、習字、筆で書く絵で余生を送っていたのだそうです。
	銀閣寺に関する小話
	ちょっとした小話をご紹介します。
	銀閣寺にはもう一つ名前があった
	タイトルの通りですとちょっと語弊がありますが、
	正式名称は実は銀閣寺ではなく「慈照寺（じしょうじ）」といいます。
	金閣寺にも名前がある通り、銀閣寺にもしっかりした名前がついています。
	金閣を真似して作ったから、銀閣。
	なんとも分かり易いネーミングでしょう。
	銀閣寺には面白い形の庭がある
	俗にいう日本庭園とはまた違った面白い庭が銀閣寺にはあります。

	もっと遊ぶ
	やっぱり、社会人にもなるとゆっくり旅行に行く時間も無くなります。
	海外に行こうと思うと、土日の休みだけでは行けません。
	会社によっては長期休暇もありますが、そういったタイミングは他の人も休みで、どこもごった返しています。
	お盆休みがまさにそれですね。
	大学生であれば、社会人に比べると時間を作りやすいです。
	比較的旅行者が少ないタイミングを見計らって行ってしまうのもありです。
	行ってみたいなという場所があれば、思いっきりバイトしてお金を作って、今しかできない経験をしておきたいですね。

	なにか実務に役立つようなスキルがあれば派遣社員としては仕事の幅が広がりそうです。
	最近ですとそういった資格を持っているだけで、資格手当がもらえるし、取れそうなものは取っておいて損はないです。
	将来役に立ちそうな資格を
	Ｔさんが言うには、パソコンの資格の他に、登録販売者の資格も取っておきたかったと言っています。
	ドラッグストアで白衣を着て薬をオススメしている人です。
	求人をみてみると、アルバイトだとしても同じお店のレジ係と比べるとすごく優遇されています。
	ただ、これに関してはやっぱり相応の勉強が必要です。
	大学生の時間があるうちに、どんどん資格を取得しておきたいですね。

	ボランティアに参加する
	東北の震災復興へ
	東北の震災があった頃、Ｔさんは大学１年生。
	必須科目が多く、ボランティアに行けなかったことを後悔しています。
	テレビで流れてくる現場の映像を見ながら、ここで勉強していてもイイのかと迷いがあったそうです。
	今の日本社会ではなかなか簡単にボランティアへ参加することができません。
	１日、２日なら行けますが長期間となると難しい。
	そんな動き辛さが今の日本人を縛っているように感じます。
	違う境遇の人と協力する経験
	なぜ、ボランティアをしておきたかったかを尋ねると、Ｔさんからの返答はこうでした。
	「生きた場所、年齢、性別が違う人と力を合わせ、困っている人を助けたり、何かを成し遂げる先に見えるものがある」
	実際、Ｔさんは大学時代も派遣会社で働き、その日合ったばかりの人と仕事をこなしていたそうです。
	そういった経験を通すと、当然、対人能力、さらには一緒に働いたその人の境遇から人生の学びを得ることができ、今後の役に立ちます。
	まとめとコメント
	ＴＡＩＪＩとは違った答えが返ってきて、勉強になりました。
	大学生のうちにしかできないコトはやはりあります。
	時間がある大学時代をどう過ごすかで、それからの人生がガラッと変わってしまう。
	そんな気がしています。
	これ、やっておいた方がイイんじゃない？
	そんな感覚があったら、ぜひ取り組んでみてください。
	取り組まなかった時よりも、１つ成長した人間になっています。

	これは、簡単ですよ。
	最初から作成する場合の、５分の１くらいの作業量です。
	この方法を使うと、何も無いところからシステムを開発する場合より格段に早く、システムを開発することができます。
	また、バグ（エラー）の発生も格段に少なくなります。
	このようにして、あなたのシステムを開発して行くのです。
	当然、アクセスの知識も向上します。
	このやり方は、現在も私がお客様のシステムを作成する時にやっている方法です。
	他のシステム会社も同じようにやっていると思います。
	このやり方の方が、絶対に短期間でミスの無いシステム／プログラムを開発することができます。
	５．「テンプレート（ひな型）」でアクセスも効率よくマスターできる？
	私は、現在、アクセスを使って、お客様のシステムを作っています。
	でも、最初は、当然システムを作れなかったのです。
	特に、フォームの作成は出来ませんでした。
	そのときは、テーブルとクエリは、大体マスターしていました。
	クエリで、いろいろなデータを作成、抽出していました。
	でも、フォームの作成が出来ないと、システムの開発することはできません。
	画面が作れないからです。
	フォームを作るのは、難しいですね。
	市販の参考書で勉強するのですが、それでもダメですね。
	一度は挫折しました。
	どうやって、使えるフォームを作るのか想像できないのです。
	だって、見たことも無いものを作るなんて出来ないですね。
	周りの人は、アクセスを知らないので、教えてもらうこともできません。
	ましてや、ＶＢＡなどはできません。
	その時に、偶然、お客様から、作りかけのアクセスのプログラムを完成して欲しいという依頼がありました。
	以前、開発しようとしていた人が途中で開発を、あきらめたそうです。
	音信不通になったそうです。
	その、動かないアクセスのプログラムを入手しました。
	これが転機です。
	私は、作りかけのプログラムのフォームやＶＢＡをみました。
	そして、フォームの中のプロパティがどのようなものか、ＶＢＡがどのように動くのか初めてわかったのです。
	「目からうろこ」です。
	「百聞は一見にしかず」です。
	これ以降、アクセスの知識が急に上達しました。
	後は、知らないことを少しずつマスターしてゆきました。
	この、ひとつのステップ（階段）を昇ることが大事ですね。
	あなたは、ソースコードのついたプログラム、「テンプレート（ひな型）」を持っていますか？

	２つ目は、「以前、作成した完成されたアクセスのプログラムを「テンプレート（ひな型）」として使うことです。」
	中途半端な、動かないプログラムではダメですよ。
	データベースの設計（項目の作成）は、新しいシステムに合わせて作成してゆきますが、テーブルやクエリをコピーして修正することもあります。
	テーブルとクエリの作成は、あまり手間はかかりませんので、最初から作成しても問題はありません。
	でも、フォームの作成は最初から作成するのは大変です。

	宅地なら建物を建てる計画、雑種地なら駐車場や資材置き場などの計画が必要とされ、転用許可後は速やかに計画を実行する必要があります。
	そのため、先に転用する場合は、申請した転用目的を一旦は達成しなくてはならなくなり、売買が目的なら先に転用する方法は非効率です。
	もっとも、すぐには売れなくても、耕作もできない事情があるなら、一旦は比較的費用がかからない駐車場に転用して、長期的に売り出す方法は十分考えられます。

	登記については、買主負担となる商習慣から、売主の負担はほとんど発生しませんが、費用負担は売買契約によって定められるので、売主負担になることもあります。
	まとめ
	農地の売買は、農地が持つ重要な役割から、法律で規制されています。
	また、農地以外に転用できるかどうかで、売買価格も買い手も異なります。
	農地転用が可能かどうかを知りたいのであれば、農地区分を農業委員会に確認してみるのが確実でしょう。
	また、売買や転用には農業委員会の許可が必要で、しかも許可されるまでには１ヶ月程度（届出による場合は１０日程度）要するため、手間も時間もかける覚悟は必要です。

	農業委員会で不許可になった場合
	売買許可または転用許可は、必ずしも許可されるとは限らないため、農地の売買契約書では、不許可になった場合の条項も定めておきます。
	不許可になった場合は、売買契約が許可を前提としている性質上、当事者からの申し入れがなくても、当然に売買契約が失効して違約金も通常発生しません。
	手付金においても、不許可であればそのまま返還される、いわゆる白紙解除です。
	ただし、不許可を理由としない一方の都合による解約では、一般的な不動産取引と同様に、買主の手付金放棄または売主の手付金倍返しになります。

	農地の査定について
	後で述べるように、農地を農地のまま売買する場合は、農業関連機関を介して行うか、個人間で売買することが多くなっています。
	不動産会社も上記の通り、手数料が安い上に買い手が限られ、さらに手間も多いとなれば、積極的に取り扱いたい案件ではないでしょう。
	ただ、転用を前提とすれば話は違います。
	農地は一般的に広大であるため、場所によってはそのような広大な土地を探すことも難しく、マンション需要などで求められることがあります。
	（実際、私の実家の近くでは、１年ほど前に遊休農地にマンションが建ちました）
	農地売買に必要な手続きと手数料
	農地売買では、農地として売るか農地以外で売るかによって必要な手続きは異なり、いずれにしても農業委員会から許可を得なくてはなりません。
	どちらも売買の流れとして大きく変わりないですが、許可なくされた売買は無効になることから、通常の不動産売買とは少し流れが違います。

	農地を売却する場合、宅地など農地以外へ転用できる農地と、農地として利用しなくてはならない農地では、買い手も異なり手続きも変わってきます。
	農地の売買で、知っておくべきことをまとめました。
	農地は用途が耕作と決まっており、農家や農業参入者以外は買うことができません。
	ただし、この制限は“農地”であって、“元は農地”なら誰にでも売ることができます。
	つまり、農地を農地以外にしてしまえば、買い手が農家や農業参入者に制限されないということで、農地以外にできるかどうかが１つの分かれ目です。

	農地の売買について。
	現在の価格相場と売却方法
	都市部を少し離れて田舎に向かうだけで、何も作られていない休耕地や、荒れてしまった耕作放棄地を目にすることは珍しくありません。
	農家の高齢化が問題になってから久しく、後継ぎがいないために農地を売却したい人、農地を相続した結果、農業ができずに不要になっている人が増えていると言います。
	ところが、国民の食料自給の礎となるべき農地は、その保護目的から売却に対し法律で極めて厳しい制限があり、自由に売却することができなくなっています。

	それでサービス内容に不満があったり、もっといろいろなサービスを使ってみたくなったら、その時に年会費のかかるカードに切り替えればＯＫです（下記記事も参考に）。
	２．カード発行会社で選ぶ：
	次におすすめなのが、クレジットカードの発行会社でどのカードを選ぶかを決めること。
	日本だけでも１００社以上のカード会社がクレジットカードを発行しているので、どの会社を選ぶかだけでもクレジットカードの比較が出来ます。
	大手カード会社がやはりいいのか？
	ではどのクレジットカード発行会社が良いのかというと、これはみなさん次第。
	基本的には大手クレジットカード会社であろうが中小クレジットカード会社であろうが買い物における使い勝手には違いはないのですが、やはりセキュリティ面での安全を重視するとか、万が一の時のサポート体制が気になるという方は大手を選ぶほうが無難です。

	普通：最初に選んだカードよりも後に選んだもののほうがお得
	『そんなこといっても変なカードを申し込んじゃったら危ないんじゃ？』と思われるかもしれませんが、日本国内で発行されているクレジットカードの中で危ないのはリボ払い専用クレジットカードと呼ばれるものくらい。
	他のカードはどれも、申し込んだとしても変な請求が来たりするようなことはないので、失敗を恐れずに安心して申込をしてもらえればなと思います（初心者が作ってはいけないリボ払い専用カードリストは下記より）＊２。
	以上、クレジットカードをどう比較して良いかわからない方に！初心者にもわかりやすく、最適なクレジットカードの選び方を解説します．．．という話題でした。

	ギターのパンの振り方
	はい、ギターなんですが、ステージ上は「上手（かみて）」「下手（しもて）」という風にツインギターで分かれるのが基本です。
	で、ボーカルギターだったり、ギターが一人だったりするパターンも、もちろんあります。
	では、ＣＤなどの音源に収録する場合はギターはどうすれば良いのか？という話ですが、上記のパターンを無視して左右に振るのが安定です。
	具体的には、以下のような例が良いと思います。

	ボーカル・コーラスのパンの振り方
	ボーカルなんですが一番自由なんじゃないかと勝手に考えています。
	が、冒険しすぎても痛い目にあいますので、まずは基本から。
	主旋律は中央
	コーラスは中央でも良いし、複数レコーディングしてＲとＬに３０くらい振って広がりを持たせても良い
	特殊効果を狙ってＲ（Ｌ）６０とかに飛ばすのもありだけど、無理しない
	コーラスは広がりと厚みを持たせる効果がありますので、左右にちょっとだけ振るというのと、同じハモリを２回録って両側に広げるか、１回録ったのを複製して左右に振る（ダブリング）のが良いでしょう。
	またパンの話ではありませんが、主旋律を食わないようにコーラスの音量は主旋律より小さめ（７割くらい）に設定して下さい。
	おわりに
	いかがでしたでしょうか。
	音源に収録する場合、多くはステージ上の立ち位置を意識しますが、一方で音響特性に配慮した振り方をしなければなりません。
	その一例がベースとバスドラムの中央徹底であったり、スリーピース編成でもギターを多重録音して左右に振ることだったりします。
	よく「スリーピースとは思えない音圧」みたいな評価を耳にしますが実際複数ギターが有るんだから当たり前です。
	デジタルレコーディングならではのからくりが存在します。
	意外と詳細に説明されていない「きほんのき」的なパンの振り方、まずはこれを押さえてから、ご自身のオリジナリティを発揮されるのがクリエイティブで良いかと思います。

	基本的に私は、ステージに立っている時の見た目に合わせてパンを配置します。
	しかし、例えばドラムなどは実際にステージで見たならばほとんどステレオ感はありませんが、ミックスになるとかなり広めに広がる事も多い楽器です。
	ですので、その辺りの事情も考慮した配置になります。
	例を挙げるならば、上手側にギターがいる場合、そのギターとハイハットが被らないようにする。
	下手も同じでギターがいる場合は、クラッシュやライドがギターに被さらない様にします。
	フロアタムなども意外とギターと被ってしまう事に注意です。
	また、ピアノとオルガンやシンセは、１人の奏者がステージ上では演奏するため同時に鳴る事は少ないのですが、ミックスでは重なる事も多々あり、同じパン振りから出す事はまずありません。
	これも例えてみるならば、ピアノが右３０くらいの場所にいるならば、オルガンが同時になる時は左３０から出す、といった具合です。
	また、シンセはソロの場合ですともちろんセンターが非常に多くなりますし、パッド系ならばミックス全体の邪魔にならない様に注意しながらも思いっきり広げる事がよくあります。
	シンセストリングスも同じで、完全に広げ過ぎるとミックスをぼやかしてしまいますが、あまりにステレオ感が狭いとせっかくのストリングスが持つ壮大さなどのイメージを発揮できません。
	ドラムとパーカッションがどちらも入っている時はその配置に特に注意しないといけません。
	７月に行ったバンドのレコーディングではちょうどリズム楽器両方が入ったものでした。
	更には、パーカッションも多種多様なものでしたので、パン振りにはかなり神経を遣いました。
	この時は、ステージ上で上手後方にパーカッションの方がいらっしゃるバンドだったため、ミックスでもその位置をベーシックに楽器によって左右に広げたり振ったりしてみました。

	２番めの「４回レコーディングする」というのはメタルで「ギターの壁」と呼ばれるような物凄い音圧のオケを作る場合に有効な手段です。
	バンドサウンドは「隙間の美学」みたいなところがあるので、原則として２本で問題ありません。
	リードギターをかぶせる場合は、３番目のように「バッキングが切れてオケがスカスカにならないように、バッキングの上にリードを重ねる」のが有効です。
	上記の例ではＲに振ろうとしていますが、下手がリードギター担当だった場合はＬでも良いでしょう。
	ボーカルがリードを弾くというパターン（凛として時雨のＴＫとか、チルボドのアレキシのような）も、聴いたときボーカルと団子にならないように左右に振るのが個人的にはおすすめです。
	バンド音源の場合、ステレオ的に左右に隙間ができやすいので、歪んだギターでもアコギでも左右に飛ばして広がりと音圧を稼ぐのが安定です。
	そういう意味で上記のような例を挙げてみました。
	ベースのパンの振り方
	ベースは簡単です。
	何も考えないで真ん中（Ｃｕｂａｓｅの表示だと「Ｃ」）で良いです。
	「ベースってバンドだと左にいるじゃん？」と思うかもしれませんが、必ず中央に置いてください。
	一般に「低音域は定位感が薄い」と言われていて、超低音は人間の耳にはどこから聴こえているのか判別しにくいそうです。
	ベースはもっといろんな倍音を含みますのでそうではないのですが、ベースを左右に飛ばしまくってる音源なんてそうそう存在しないのは音楽好きな皆様ならよくわかるかと思いますので、余計な冒険をしないのが懸命です。
	ドラムスのパンの振り方
	はい、ドラムが一番シビアというかめんどくさいです。
	なぜならばキットピースによって定位が異なるからです。
	つまり、バスドラムはここ、スネアはここ、ハイハットはここ、みたいな個別の配置が必要になります。
	それはなぜか？一般的にはオケに広がりを持たせるためとかドラムスのキットが一箇所にまとまっているわけではないのを表現するためと言われています。
	個人的には全部中央においたらごっちゃりしすぎて音圧稼げないからという説を推してみます。
	とりあえず、基本は以下を守れば問題ないと思います。

	外国で言語を教えたり、営業で飛び回ったりなど、仕事のなかには、旅の要素がもとから組み込まれているものもあります。
	逆に、趣味の旅行をしながら、いくばくかのお金を稼ぐ方法もあります。
	大金とはいきませんが、ちょっと贅沢な夕食代や博物館の入場料を稼ぐことぐらいなら十分に可能です。

	特定の人種や民族などへの憎悪をあおるヘイトスピーチについて法務省は、公共施設の使用許可の判断基準やヘイトスピーチの典型を例示した文書を、地方自治体に提供している。
	昨年６月のヘイトスピーチ対策法施行を踏まえた「参考情報」の位置づけで、「ヘイトスピーチ対策プロジェクトチーム」が作成した。
	法務省人権擁護局は「積極的にヘイトスピーチを解消する取り組みを進めてほしい」と話す。
	公共施設の使用許可について、地方自治法は「正当な理由がない限り、住民が公の施設を利用することを拒んではならない」と規定している。
	このため今回の文書は、事前に判明している集会などの内容・実施方法や主催者が過去に行った同種イベントから「諸事情を総合的に勘案して判断する」とした。
	不許可とする場合は、表現行為の事前規制となり、表現や集会の自由を保障した憲法との関係が問題になる。
	このため文書は、不許可とする要件や、自治体側の判断の手続きを公表するよう推奨している。

	ＴＶ番組『ダウンタウンのガキの使いやあらへんで！！』内の企画で人気の高い「笑ってはいけない」シリーズ。
	何があっても絶対に「笑ってはいけない」というルールで、出演者は収録に挑みます。
	もし、笑ってしまった場合はその場で罰を受けます。
	「笑ってはいけない」という緊張感がまた、笑いを誘発するのです。
	そんな同企画の仕込みかと思うような広告が、年始早々にＳＮＳを中心に話題となりました。
	その広告とは、小林製薬の鼻うがい製品「ハナノア」。
	鼻うがいとは、鼻の穴からダイレクトに洗浄液を注入するうがいの方法で、これが花粉症などにも効果がみられるのです。
	専用の洗浄液を鼻に入れて流すことで、鼻の奥に入った花粉、ハウスダスト、雑菌などをまるごと洗い流す同製品。
	花粉の時期に「鼻をとってまるごと洗いたい」と思う方には、もってこいの花粉対策といえるでしょう。

	これは異常な数字ともいえる。
	鉄緑会は、首都圏には東京・代々木にしか校舎がなく、関西の大阪校は梅田、西宮北口、京都の３教室があるだけ、全国展開はしていない。
	二大都市圏以外の地方圏から実質的に通うことができない。
	にもかかわらず、東京校から３７人、大阪校から１７人がそれぞれ理三に合格している。
	冨田氏は「実は６割という数字には我々も驚いています。昨年は東大の数学の入試問題が６問中の１問がまるまる当たったこともありますが、首都圏や関西圏では、うちに通わずに東大理三に合格しているのは灘高校（神戸市）の一部の生徒さんぐらいでしょうね」と話す。
	東大受験に強い進学塾や予備校と言えば、東進ハイスクールや駿台予備校などの名前が思い浮かぶ。
	しかし、筑波大学付属駒場高校（筑駒、東京・世田谷）や開成高校（東京・荒川）、桜蔭高校（東京・文京）、灘高校など、「首都圏と関西圏の有名進学校の上位成績者がこぞって通うのが鉄緑会だ」と大手塾関係者は口をそろえる。
	筑駒から東大に進学し、英単語アプリ「ｍｉｋａｎ」を起業した宇佐美峻氏は、「筑駒は校則もなく自由な学校。文化祭とか、自分の好きなことは学校でやるが、受験対策は鉄緑会でやるという生徒が多かった」という。

	今後配信するタイトルはアイテム課金のモデルを採用しており、ファイアーエムブレムは一般的に「ガチャシステム」と呼ばれる、ランダム型アイテム供給方式を導入した。
	発表済みのタイトル以外にも年間２～３本ペースでの配信を予定しており、どれだけ収益を拡大できるか注目だ。
	■ついに社運を懸けたスイッチが登場！
	そして３月３日には、新型ゲーム機「ＮｉｎｔｅｎｄｏＳｗｉｔｃｈ」（スイッチ）を発売する。
	スイッチは液晶画面のついた本体と左右に分割されたコントローラーで構成される。
	コントローラーには各種センサーが内蔵され、さまざまな操作に対応。
	微細な振動で手で触った感触を再現する機能も採用した。
	テレビに接続したり、携帯機としてプレーしたりすることも可能だ。
	希望小売価格は２万９９８０円。
	ゲーム機単体でも利益を出せる。
	任天堂の戦略の根幹は、ゲーム機とともにソフトも自社で積極的に展開し、収益を拡大することだ。
	そのため、ゲーム機のヒット次第でその後の業績が大きく左右される。

	それまで任天堂のゲームを販売していなかった地域でもプレーされていることに触れ、「全世界の幅広い皆様にお届けすることができた」とＩＰの広がりを強調した。
	収益面はどうか。
	スマホゲームの主流は、基本プレーを無料にしてアイテム課金で収益を稼ぐモデルだ。
	一方、マリオランは一部無料で１２００円を支払えば全編遊べる「買い切り方式」を採用し、注目されていた。

	■スマホは人気タイトルを次々に投入
	ただし、重要なのは足元の業績ではなく今後の動向だ。
	２月から３月末にかけて、任天堂の将来を左右する製品が続々と投入される。
	大きな柱の一つがスマホ向けゲームだ。
	２月２日にシミュレーションＲＰＧ『ファイアーエムブレムヒーローズ』を配信。
	昨年１２月に米アップル製品向けに配信し、７８００万ダウンロードを突破した『スーパーマリオラン』（マリオラン）も３月にアンドロイド端末向けに配信する。
	３月までの発売を予定していた『どうぶつの森』は、前述の２タイトルを配信したことと、その運営対応を優先するため延期となり、２０１７年度中にリリースされる見込みだ。

	地球影（地球自身の影）とは
	『低い位置からの太陽光が大気の影響（レイリー散乱）で赤色中心に残り、反対側の大気上層のスクリーンに投影されている』．．．ことは判ります。
	しかし、観察地点からみて地球の影まで見えるという状況が納得いきません。
	太陽光が屈折する可能性を考えたのですが、屈折に関する記述は特に見当たらず。

	以上のお答えは、吉田隆一氏からいただきました。
	バリトンサックスに限らず、他の管楽器にも言えることですが、まず第一に「息がしっかり楽器に入っているかな？」ということです。
	まずｆｆでロングトーンをすることが手っ取り早いでしょう。
	とにかく沢山息を吸って、出来るだけ音を長くのばしてみてください。
	このとき音が震えないようにね！沢山息をとって、沢山吹く。
	単純ですがコレなんです。
	楽器（道具）の事から云えば、自分に合ったリードを見つける事です。
	特にサックスの場合はリードという厄介なものと仲良くなることが必要不可欠ですね。
	リードを選ぶ時には必ず、速い息を使って音を出して下さい。
	ちなみに速い息というのは、まず右手を開いて、指は閉じ、口から約５ｃｍ前に、そう！「オホホッ」いう感じで！そこで息を右手に吹きかける。
	こうやって確認してみて下さい。
	この時、温度を感じてくださいね。
	冷たければ○、暖かければ×。
	冷たい息＝速い息ということになりますね。

	道具のことを書いてしまいましたが一番重要なのはやはり毎日の練習です。
	日々の練習ではロングトーンの他に音階・半音階・アルペジオを混ぜてやると良いでしょう。
	なにか一つ決まった教本を使うといいですね。
	後で記ますね。
	先ほどもいったように何を吹くときでも必ず息の流れに注意して下さい。
	また、演奏会など生のいい音を聴くこと、ＣＤを聴きまくることです。
	自分が出したい音のイメージを持つことがとても大事です。
	ただなんとなく漠然と楽器を吹くのではなく、必ず音に対するイメージを持って、そして息の流れを意識しながら吹く！意識して意識して意識して吹いていって・・・終いには無意識にできればもう最高！こういう習慣ができるといいですね。
	まずは意識をすること。
	必ず上手くなりますよ。
	漠然と吹いているのと注意しながら吹くのでは、まったく違う結果が現れてくるから。
	あなどるなかれ！毎日の積み重ねが大事って事だね。

	例えばパーカッションの人たちがやる「基礎打ち」の感覚で、４分→８分→３連→１６分と言った感じでメトロノームに合わせて最低音をタンギングしてみましょう。
	音量は極力落としてみます。
	最初はメトロノームを６０くらいに合わせて、徐々に早めてみましょう。
	目標は１２０！（この早さで１６分をシングルタンギングで出来たら相当な技術です）最低音からＧの音くらいまで、それを何度も繰り返してみましょう。
	小さな音でやることによって、少しずつ低音域のコントロールも身に付いてくるので一石二鳥です。

	なお、中にはペニシリンに対してアレルギーを有している患者さんがいます。
	この場合はペニシリンアレルギーを防ぐため、ペニシリン系抗生物質を他の抗菌薬に変えて投与しなければいけません。
	どうしてもペニシリン系抗生物質を使用したい場合、少量から投与して徐々に投与量を増やすことで慣れさせていきます。
	これを脱感作といいます。
	脱感作をすれば、ペニシリン系抗生物質を投与しても問題ありません。
	ペニシリン系抗生物質の作用機序
	細菌とヒトの細胞を比べたとき、細菌には細胞壁があるものの、ヒトの細胞には細胞壁がありません。
	そこで、ペニシリン系抗生物質では、細胞壁の合成を阻害することでその作用を発揮します。
	細胞壁がなければ、細菌の細胞内に水が流入してくるようになります。
	その結果、細胞が膨張して破裂し、死滅していきます。
	そのため、ペニシリン系抗生物質は殺菌性抗菌薬に分類されます。

	方法１：「思いこみ」を壊す
	思いこみを壊すには、反対の証拠や例をあげていくのが効果的です。
	先の例で、「私はバカだ」という思いこみの反対の例をあげいきます。
	「私は、一生で一度も、バカだといわれたことがない」
	「私の仕事ぶりは、沢山の人に評価されている。だからバカではない」
	とりあえず、質よりも量が大事です。
	頭のなかで考えるだけでなく、どんどん紙やパソコンに理詰めで書いていきましょう。
	そして最後に感情をこめて読み上げましょう。
	そうすれば、「アッ！これって思い込みだ！」とあなたの脳が客観的に認識するはずです。

	方法４：多様性をもって「思いこみ」を受けいれる
	主張をするから、衝突が発生します。
	もっと柔軟に肩の荷をおろしてものごとを見てみれば、たいしたことがないとおもえる場合があります。
	「私はバカなのはある部分で正しい。私がバカでないのもある部分で正しい。どちらの見方もある。世の中には常に多様な見方があって当然だ。わたしは相手にどう思われてもいいし、相手を訂正する気もない。すべてを受け入れよう。」
	神のような広い愛と心で世の中をみてみましょう。
	方法５：「思いこみ」は空である―「色即是空」
	般若心経の有名なフレーズ「色即是空、空即是色」に学びましょう。
	私たちが五感をとおして認知している現物と思っているものは、すべて「空」です。
	「思いこみ」も「空」です。
	固定実体はありません。
	しょせん、あなたの頭の中でおこっている幻なのです。
	そんなことで悩むのはナンセンスです。
	すべては無常（常では無い）なのです。
	それは存在しているともいえるし、存在していないともいえます。
	すべては絶えざる変化の相互作用のなかで、仮に存在している移ろいゆくものなのです。
	悩みが浮かんできたら「これはたんなる妄想だ」とおもってフッと棚上げしましょう。
	できることなら、忘れましょう。
	そんな幻想には惑わされずに、目の前のことに集中するのです。
	「根性論」という名の檻（おり）に自分を閉じこめない
	思いこみの正体がわかっても、それに根性でそれと戦うのを美徳とするひとがいます。
	「現実から目をそむけるな！」と自分にムチをうつのです。
	それをやっているかぎり、永遠に心はやすらぐことができません。
	思いこみを無効化するのは「逃げ」や「あきらめ」ではありません。
	障害に直面したときに、それを「つらい悩み」にせず「チャレンジングなクイズ」にしてしまうのが、思いこみの無効化なのです。
	「人生の荷物は、最小限に。」
	それがミニマリスト（最小限主義者）の秘訣です。
	自分の頭の中は、自分の都合の良いように使ってみてはいかがでしょうか。
	愛情とともに。

	●「人口減少で経済ゼロ成長」はあまりにも悲観的すぎないか？
	このように、人口減少が日本にとって大問題であることは間違いありません。
	そして人口減少問題が意識されてからの数十年間、とりわけ経済については、人口減少によって今後は右肩下がり、よくてゼロ成長だろうという悲観論が、半ば常識的に語られてきました。
	しかし、私はこうした見方に異議を唱えています。
	人口減少を悲観的にしか語らない人は、経済成長というものについて、人々がツルハシを持って道路工事をするイメージしか持ち合わせていないからです。
	経済の供給サイドについて言えば、よく語られるのはこういうことです。
	労働力人口の減少によって、１００人で工事をしていた工事現場の労働者が１０人に減ると、アウトプットは９０人分減ってしまう。
	それが国全体で起きれば、日本はマイナス成長になる――。

	赤字８．３兆円の意味
	しかし、財政健全化目標をいとも簡単に取り下げたり、延期したりできないというのも実情だ。
	安倍首相は、消費税増税の再延期の際、２０２０年度の財政健全化目標は堅持すると強調した。
	さらに、安倍首相は、「経済再生なくして財政健全化なし」とも繰り返し述べている。
	財政健全化がうまくいかないと認めれば、経済成長を見込んだ税収増が予定通りに得られないと認めたこととなる。
	そして、経済成長がうまくいかないのはアベノミクスが失敗した証拠と、野党による追及の格好の口実となりかねない。
	そうした懸念があるので、石原経済再生相は、冒頭の発言のように答えるしかないのだろう。
	８．３兆円の赤字は大きいとみるべきか、小さいとみるべきか。
	確かに、残り３回の予算編成で、容易に目標を達成できるとはいい難い数字だ。
	かといって、財政健全化目標を取り下げるほどのものではない。
	■経済再生ケースなら２０２４年に目標達成
	もし財政健全化目標を取り下げるか達成年次を延期すればどうなるだろうか。
	今年１月の内閣府の「中長期試算」にある国と地方を合わせた基礎的財政収支の対ＧＤＰ比の推移を見ると、名目経済成長率が３％後半で推移すると見込む経済再生ケースで、２０２０年度の基礎的財政収支は対ＧＤＰ比で１．４％（８．３兆円）の赤字である。
	試算の前提は、消費税率を２０１９年１０月に引き上げるがそれ以外は現行の税制のままで、既に決まった歳出改革は織り込むがそれ以外は現行制度のまま推移するというものだ。
	追加の改革を行わないいわば自然体の財政運営でいけば、２０２０年度にそうなるという予測である。
	経済再生ケースで行くと、自然体の財政運営のままでも、２０２４年度にはほぼ基礎的財政収支は黒字化する見通しだ。
	要するに、何も追加の改革なしに２０２４年度に基礎的財政収支は黒字化するのだから、財政健全化目標を取り下げるか達成年次を延期するということは、「追加の改革はしたくない」というのと同じことである（もちろん、名目成長率が３％台後半にならなければそれさえも実現できないのだが）。
	未曽有の人口減少時代に突入しつつある日本では、労働力人口や消費の減少により、近い将来、経済が衰退するのではないかという不安が募っている。
	しかし、それは本当だろうか。
	もしも、人口減少にもかかわらず経済が成長し、日本人が豊かになれる未来があるとしたら――。
	実は、そんなシナリオを唱える専門家は現実にいる。
	マクロ経済学に精通する吉川洋・立正大学経済学部教授が唱える、これまでとは違う「人口と日本経済」論に耳を傾けよう。

	キレカジファッションは若者だけ？
	２０代を中心に流行っているキレカジファッションですが、若い年代の人だけができる
	ファッションというわけではありません。
	色やデザイン、サイズなど自分にあったアイテム
	を組み合わせれば、３０代、４０代以上でも十分にチャレンジできるファッションです。
	特に中年以降の男性は休日のカジュアルファッションが苦手と言う人も多いですが、
	キレカジのポイントさえ押さえていれば、清潔感溢れるコーディネートができます。
	しかも無理な若づくりをせず、オシャレで若々しい自分を演出することもできます。

	マルチのマフラーにワインのコートを合わせた着こなし画像
	ただの赤とは違う、ワインのダッフルコートはグッと大人の魅力が高まる１着。
	丈が短いので脚長に見える効果もあります。
	ボタンを閉じてもすっきりして見えますが、写真では前を開けて、アクセントとなるマルチカラーのマフラーを見せています。
	これにより、トップスがホワイトのカットソーでも地味に見えません。
	上半身がカラフルな分、下半身はブラックのタイトなカーゴパンツとバブーシュシューズで、全体のバランスを上手くとっています。

	キレイめカジュアルを略して、キレカジと呼びます。
	カジュアルなのにキレイ、
	清潔感があるというのがポイントです。
	ジャケットにジーンズを合わせるなど、
	割とカッチリ目なアイテムにラフなアイテムを合わせてカジュアルダウンをする
	のが基本です。
	頭の先からつま先までキレイ目にして、まるで仕事着になって
	しまうのを防ぎます。
	別名ヨーロピアンスタイルと呼ばれることもあります。

	それ以外の道、例えば音楽ライターとかスタッフ、マネージャーは普通に不安定で薄給のブラック企業勤めと変わらず、レーベルやマネジメント会社、イベント会社の運営等は将来性の薄い起業と言い換えられる。
	どちらも音楽制作者から一歩遠い所に位置する為今回は上記２種の業種について考えたい。
	一口にアーティストと言えど、作曲家を兼ねていたり兼ねていなかったり形態は様々
	「アーティストはバンドマンで、作曲家は曲作ってるヤツだろ。わかってるよ」
	と、自分の認識確認の為に無意識にこのページを開いたアナタ。
	安心して欲しい。
	わかってるようで結構わかってない部分もある。
	今回はそういう部分の説明、ひいてはみんなが大好きなお金の話をしたい。

	バンドで食っていきたい！なんて人は夢破れた時のことも含めて大学に進学した方がいいと思う。
	あとゴーストライティングが好きな人とか？お勧めです。
	なるためには
	アーティスト
	まず昔ながらのやり方というか、一番一般的な道というか、ライブハウスで活動していくやつ。
	コンスタントにライブハウスでライブをしたりツアーをしたりしている内に業界の人に目をつけられてデビューとか、そういうやつ。
	これの怖いところは、この一連の流れが事態がライブハウスやレコ屋の経済システムの一部であること。
	あとは事務所とかレーベルとかにデモを送ったり、何かしらのコネでつながったりだとか。
	身も蓋もないがそうとしか言いようがない。
	最近だとボカロＰや歌い手とかツイキャス主、ニコ生主とかブロガーだとかその辺で有名になってからバンドを始めるのも増えてきている。
	そういう意味ではそういうのナシで始められるし有名人の息子とかズルいよな。
	後は運。
	とにかく運。
	どれだけ実力があったとしても運がないと全く日の目をみないことだってザラにある。
	作曲家・演奏家
	コネ。
	一言でいえばコネ。
	もうちょっとマシな言い方をすると師匠とかからの紹介とか。
	大体誰かしらのつながりでどうこうなることが多い。
	一応ネットでも「作曲家募集」とか「スタジオミュージシャン募集」とかで検索すると多少出てくるけど、検索して出てきた結果をみてもらえればなんとなく察しがつくと思う・・・。
	あとオーディションとかね。
	雑誌とかにもたまに広告がのってたり検索したりしたら割とでてくる。
	あとミュージシャンから都落ちを経て所属レーベルの編曲作曲家になるパターンもまま見られる。
	最近ではネットで有名になってそこから仕事がもらえるようになるという、２１世紀らしいやり方もあるが、音楽の技術を磨きつつネットで有名になるために努力もせねばならんという、修羅の道ということだけ伝えておこう。
	お金
	アーティスト
	（かなり）売れたら食える。
	事務所との契約内容やメンバーの数、物販などの売れ行きなど様々な要素が絡むので一概には言えないが、今まで聴いた感じだと全国でワンマン、またはツーマンくらいの規模のライブを開催できるようになれば、どうにか食えるようになるみたいだ。
	逆に言えばそれ以下ぐらいの規模のバンドになると、アレだ、ステージに立っているときではない時間はアルバイトでもして暮らしているのだ。
	結果を出して契約を取れば給料制のうちに働くことができるが、数年やって伸びがなければまあ打ち切りである。
	売れてるバンドだって１０年後まだ大箱を埋められているか、そういう事を考えると本当に厳しい世界だ。
	運が良かったりするとレーベルの社員としてそこに残ったりするケースもあったりするみたいだけど、メンバー全員分の席が空いているほど余力があるレーベルなんて残念ながら日本はないだろう。
	察しがつきますよね。
	今のライブキッズたちは１０年後大掃除か何かで当時買っていたＣＤやＴシャツをみつけ
	「あ、このバンド好きだったなあ。いま何しているんだろ？」
	そんな事を考える。
	そのバンドはね、今ギターとベースは地元に帰って割りばしやオシボリを配達する仕事をしながら親の介護をして、ボーカルは結婚詐欺で東京に居座ってるよ。
	怖いのはこれが実例ってことだよ。
	怖いね。
	作曲家・演奏家
	（業界内で）売れっ子にならないと生活が危うい。
	「俺！音楽で食ってく！」ってキラキラして目で上京していった知り合いは、その後嬉々としてプロになったと報告をしてくれたが、実際蓋を開けてみたら楽器店のアルバイトが生活の基盤になっていた。
	一応聞いたことない名前のゲームのＢＧＭとか作ってるみたいだけど・・・。
	（アーティスト業に比べたら）運がなくてもスキルとコネがあれば生き残れるが、いかんせん需要と供給のバランスが極端に悪いので、働く側が超供給過多状態。
	他業種なら月収１００万くらい稼げるんじゃないかってほどの技術を身に着けてやっと人並みの生活を送ることができる。
	最低限求められるスキルが高すぎる。
	さらに言うと人間性まで求められる。
	ある程度の年齢までに自分の”稼ぎパターン”みたいなのを構築できないと、若いのと同様の低所得、高負荷労働で死ぬ。
	ちなみに僕が見てきた限りだと”アーティスト”商売の音楽業界よりも、こっちの方がオジサンが多い。
	ついで歯に衣着せずに言うと９０年代の感覚のままのオジサンが多い。
	喩えに出すのは申し訳ないんだけど、わかりやすく言えば浜崎あゆみのバックバンドのヨっちゃんみたいな人が多い。
	コレはあくまで僕のイメージだとは断っておきたいんだけど。
	さらに言うとそういうオジサンたちは長年培ったアレもあったりして、やたら演奏が上手い上に業界に顔が利くしコネをたっぷり持ってるので若手に仕事が回ってこない。
	音楽業界に限らず日本の社会の縮図みたいだなこれ・・・。
	若者に十分回ってくるほど仕事があればいいんだけどね。

	優しく包み込むオブラートのような声の人もいれば、歌手の和田アキ子さんのように男性的な声の人もいる。
	代表的な声楽家には、ＮａｔｈａｌｉｅＳｔｕｔｚｍａｎｎがいる。
	ＮａｔｈａｌｉｅＳｔｕｔｚｍａｎｎは本物のアルト歌手だ。
	アルトは、ソプラノとかのように声質によって細分化されることは特にない気がする。
	そもそも、日本人のアルト歌手自体希少である。
	人によってはテノールの低いほうの音域まで出せる。
	とあるアルト歌手は、合唱でテノールを担当したことがあるらしい。
	また、合唱などでは、
	ソプラノに対して低い旋律を受け持つパートのことを意味することが多いが、
	その場合は声種でいうところのアルトとは別物と考えるべきだろう。
	男声が歌う女声（男声アルト）のことをカウンターテナー（後述）という。
	テノール
	テノールは、基本的にテンションの高いイメージがある。
	若さや勇ましさ、潔さや清楚さなどを表現するにふさわしい声種だろう。
	個人的には、王子様といったイメージも少なからずあるが、
	神がかった上品で崇高なテノールには脳内までもが痺れてくる。

	今回は声種に関するお話でしたが、いかがでしたか？
	今回ご説明した内容は、必ずこう定義されている！！というわけではないので、
	軽い気持ちで参考にしていただけたら幸いです。
	あなたはどんな声種ですか？？
	日本人って、普段はけっこう不自然な声で喋っていたりするので、
	本当の自分の声が何なのか、まだ分からない方も多いと思います。
	リラックスして正しい発声法で発する素の声こそ、あなたの本当の声♪
	一回それを見つけてみてはいかがでしょうか？
	今日は、ここまでにしたいと思います。

	バス
	女声のアルトと同じく、日本人では希少である。
	これも細分化されないと思う。
	バスバリトンと比べても声域はほぼ変わらないが、
	より深く厚く、地を這ってくるような感じがする。
	王様や悪魔など、偉大なる役柄を演じる上で適しているかもしれない。
	バス歌手には体もデカい人が多く、舞台映えも半端ない気がする。
	少し古い人でイギリスのバロック声楽家ＤａｖｉｄＴｈｏｍａｓ（アメリカの歌手とは別人）がいるが、
	彼はバス歌手の割に威圧感がなく、私としては割と好きな声だ。
	その他の声種
	以上では、６つの声種を細分化して分類してみました。
	細分化の仕方や、それぞれの明確な定義はけっこう曖昧だったりしますが、
	まあ、だいたいこんな感じです！
	ってことで、参考にしてみてください♪
	では、最後に、特種なものを・・・。
	・カウンターテナー
	・カストラート
	このふたつです。
	では、説明していきましょう！

	声種と、それぞれのタイプ
	それでは、ひとつずつみていきましょう！
	説明は主観的で、私自身の偏見もちょっとだけ含まれておりますのであしからず笑
	ソプラノ
	女性としてのかわいらしさや若さ・幼さ、崇高さ、
	そして愛おしさや明るさの表現に適す声域のように思う。
	日本のアイドルとか可愛い系タレントはソプラノのイメージが強い。
	元々声が低い女性でも、男に媚びるとソプラノになったりするから不思議だ。

	１日を２５時間と認識している体内時計を起床後にリセットすることが必要になります。
	効果的なリセットを行うにはカーテンを開けて太陽の光を浴びることと朝食を取ることが必須です（胃腸が弱い方は朝食は少なめでも構いませんが、一般にはある程度の分量があったほうがリセット効果は高いとされます）。
	可能であれば２０分以上の散歩をするとより効果的です。
	？【３】朝の行き場を作ること
	予備校の本科生にならない場合、たとえば朝食をファストフード店で取り１時間程度の勉強をしてくる習慣をつける、朝９時に図書館に入るなど、朝の行き場を作ることが非常に大切です。

	？大手予備校の場合講師の移動が活発で生徒数が多いため丁寧な指導までは難しい場合があります。
	大学院生のチューター（アドバイザー）を置きフォローする予備校を選ぶのが最低限ですが、予備校講師に比べ指導力は落ちます。
	理科、数学に関しては、中小予備校や個別塾を併用するのもひとつの案です。
	※東京、千葉、埼玉エリアの予備校情報を筆者はつかんでいますので、ご相談されたい場合お問い合わせをご利用ください（高校名、志望大学、高３時の偏差値、特に対策したい教科を明記）。

	失敗例６文系数学と理系国語で失敗
	？国立文系志望者にとって「数学」の勉強時間は自然と短くなりがちです。
	もともと数学が苦手、面白みを感じないので勉強時間が減る、週に１、２回しか触れないため伸びていかないというプロセスを歩みがちです。
	国語や社会でライバルの文系生に差をつけるのは難しいですが、数学なら不可能ではありません。
	毎日触れることが必要です。
	？国立理系志望者にとって「国語」および「地歴公民」の勉強時間は自然と短くなりがちです。
	もともと国社は苦手、面白みを感じないので勉強時間が減る、週に１、２回しか触れないため伸びていかないというプロセスを歩みがちです。
	国語はセンター試験であっても本格的な学力が必要です。
	古文、漢文、現代文の順に対策していきます（センター現代文は７割程度得点できるならそこからは伸ばしづらいため時間を割かないのもひとつの方法です。しかし地頭が育つため問題量は少なくても徹底的に深めることがおすすめです）。
	？現代社会は暗記科目なので秋以降に回すという国立理系志望の生徒が目立ちます。
	しかしセンター試験は付け焼刃の暗記では誤答する性質が高いため、１学期から手をつけ多少の深みと広がりのある理解に持っていくことが本番で失敗を防ぐコツです。

	？大学受験において英語の配点が高いのは、今後のグローバル社会に合わせてという理由ではありません。
	英語の点数が高いことが、中１から高３にかけて一度もサボらなかったことの証明になるからという要素があります。
	逆に言えば、中３高１までさかのぼって英語の勉強を計画的に行えば、伸ばすことは不可能ではありません。
	英語の苦手な浪人生が失敗するのは、初めから大学受験レベルの問題集に取り組むからです。
	失敗例３授業を受けるだけで、伸びなかった
	小学生
	？中高一貫校出身の生徒は関係ありませんが、高校受験を経験した生徒は「もう一度同じことをすれば良いんでしょ？」と１年を過ごし失敗することがあります。
	特に中３のときに塾に通っていた生徒ほど失敗しやすくなります。
	？その理由は高校受験塾がやや過保護すぎることにあります。
	高校には中学生のほぼ全員が進むため、勉強下手な生徒も多くいます。
	そのため塾側が授業、宿題、問題集、自習室の管理を通じて、塾に来るだけである程度得点できるシステムを作り上げています。
	高校受験塾経験者（特に成功組やあまり深く考えずに受験した生徒）は、「もう一度同じことをすれば良いんでしょ？」と予備校や塾の授業を受けることで満足してしまい成績が伸びないことが良くあります。

	失敗例８３００時間勉強する前にギブアップする
	マラソン
	？勉強、資格、ビジネスなどあらゆるものごとは最初の１０００時間を越えることで見える世界が変わると言われています。
	例えば運動神経ゼロの高校生が、夏休みに１日８時間本気で練習に取り組めば、９月には苦手意識がなくなり次の段階が見えるようになっています。
	？受験の教科に関しては、予備校講師と大学受験総括責任者を経験した筆者の感覚から言えば「３００時間」が苦手脱出のめどになります。
	例えば数学が苦手で浪人をしてしまったなら、３月に１日１０時間数学の勉強に取り組んでみてください。
	４月には数学の問題が「楽しい」または「それほど苦でない」というレベルに必ず上がります。
	失敗例９４月からまたは夏から本格始動する
	子どもベンチ森
	？予備校の授業が４月からであるため、４月から勉強を始動しようという人がいます。
	失敗例８で説明したように、３月の１ヶ月だけで苦手科目をひとつ克服できるだけの勉強時間が取れます。
	３月に休む人の言い分はたいてい「猛勉強したから充電をしたい」となりますが、１８歳前後の人間の脳は１年半程度の猛勉強の連続には簡単に耐えます（２浪目の場合は１ヶ月休ませても良い）。
	浪人が決まったその日からスタートするのが当然です。
	？浪人しても１学期をマイペースで流し、夏以降（ひどいと９月以降）に本格的なモードに切り替える人がいます。
	多くの受験生は遅くとも４月に完全なスタートを切っていますので、夏以降の本格スタートは論外となります。
	【まとめ】「浪人生」９つの失敗例を予備校講師が指摘
	失敗例１夜型生活になり伸びなかった
	失敗例２英語が伸びなかった
	失敗例３授業を受けるだけで、伸びなかった
	失敗例４大学に進んだ同級生と遊んでしまった
	失敗例５理科、数学の質問環境がなかった
	失敗例６文系数学と理系国語で失敗
	失敗例７早慶や旧帝大の壁を破れなかった
	失敗例８３００時間勉強する前にギブアップする
	失敗例９４月からまたは夏から本格始動する

	３．同じ内容はまとめて書く
	・希望的観測は厳禁
	・業務上、書くべき事は必ず書く（業務を知る）
	・報告書の中に、課題は何か？が明確に書かれている
	それ以外の部分の書き方
	宛名：
	役職の後に「殿」をつける組織とつけない組織がある。
	一般的には、組織としての書き方を上司・先輩に聞いた方がいい。
	氏名の記入と押印：
	報告書には自分の部署と名前を書いて、押印する。
	その際、印はまっすぐ（か、やや左向き（お辞儀をしているように？））に押すこと。
	照会先電話：
	自分の名前の下に、内線表示などの連絡先を書く場合もある。
	項番のつけ方：
	・「１」→「（１）」→「ａ」
	・「１」→「１－１」→「１－１－１」など、
	これも、組織によってルールが決まっているものなので、それにしたがって書く。
	所見（所感）
	「所見」は記す場合と、そうでない場合がある。
	「所見」は、伝えておきたい自分の意見がある場合や、先方の表情や態度などの場の細かなニュアンスなどを報告した方が良いと思ったら、それを１文程度にまとめて書く。
	「所見」には自分の意見が入ってもかまいませんが、極力、自分の主観や推測を入れてはいけません。
	報告書は”事実”を報告するものです。
	特に希望的観測は厳禁です。
	添付資料
	添付資料がある場合は、最後に日時・タイトル・ページ数を書く。
	資料には、ページ数を明記し、「別紙１」「別紙２」などのように番号を表示しておくとわかりやすい。

	その分初心者には育てやすいのですが、他の植物を枯らしてしまうため注意が必要です。
	しかし私達が爽快な清涼感を感じる香り元、ペパーミントの主成分のメントールは冷却作用や鎮痛作用があることから冒頭でもお話ししたように様々な用途があるため私達の生活に役立つハーブの一つです。
	ミントの生育適温と好適環境
	ミントの生育適温は１５～２５°Ｃです。
	冬は地上部は枯れてしまいますが根は生きていますので翌春また出てきます。
	冬に収穫したい場合は１０°Ｃ以上を維持した室内で管理すれば収穫することができます。
	好適環境は日当たりがよく風通しの良い場所で育てましょう。
	極端な乾燥に弱いので乾燥させすぎには注意です。
	タネと苗から栽培
	ミントはタネからも育てられますが初心者なら苗から栽培を始めた方がより簡単なので今回は苗からの栽培方法で進めていきます。
	苗選びと植え付け時期

	「××だったらどうしよう．．．．．．」「もしも××になったら．．．．．．」そんな考えに心が押しつぶされそうになってしまうことはありませんか？不安に心をどっぷり支配されている時には、なかなか気持ちが切り替えられないもの。
	もがけばもがくほど深みにはまってしまいます。
	そこで今回は、不安で心がいっぱいの時に思い出してほしい４つの事実をご紹介します。
	不安になるのは当たり前
	どんなに明るく前向きに見える人でも、人間なら必ず不安になることはあります。
	心配事や気がかりなことがあるときに、不安を感じるのは人としてごく自然なこと。
	心理学で有名な“白クマのことだけは考えるな！”という実験にあるように「考えてはダメ」と強く拒絶すると、よりそのことばかりを考えるようになってしまいます。
	まずは“不安に思っていること自体”を拒絶せず、「私はこれを不安に思っているんだ」とその気持ちを受け入れてしまいましょう。
	心配性の方が失敗を回避できる
	不安で心がいっぱいになってしまった時には、そんな自分に自己嫌悪に陥ってしまうのでは？でも、実際に最悪のシナリオを予想して、それに合わせた解決策を考えることで失敗を未然に防げることもあるのです。
	実際「心配性の人の方が仕事のパフォーマンスが高かった」なんて研究結果も。
	「××が起こったらどうしよう．．．．．．」と不安に思うところから、もう一歩進んで「××が起こった時のために、こんな対処法を練っておこう！」と解決策を考えてみて。
	対処法も一緒に想像することで不安を和らげることができるはず。
	他人の目線で見てみる
	例えば“出産”について不安に感じたとき。
	「本当に母親になれるだろうか．．．．．．」という漠然とした不安から始まり「子育てがうまくいかなかったら．．．．．．」「もし夫が病気で働けなくなったら．．．．．．」なんてあることないこと、どんどんと不安のスパイラルにはまってしまいますよね。
	そんな時は自分の考えにどっぷりと浸かってしまう前に、“これは友人の不安事”として捉えてみて。
	もし、あなたの友人が「子どもが産まれるんだけど、主人が病気で働けなくなったらどうしよう．．．．．．」と相談してきたら、あなたはきっと冷静に「今そんなこと考えても仕方ないじゃん！」と答えるはず。
	不安にどっぷり心を占領されてしまったら、心の中にもう一人相談役を見つけてみましょう。
	統計的には．．．．．．起こらない！

	心配心はご法度の心１
	心配ごころは、毒素を発散しているとは多くの人の知らないことだと思います。
	「御法度の心」であることを不思議に思う人もあるのでは？と思います。
	まずに
	吉丸房江さんの「あのねだいじょうぶだいじょうぶ」の本の一部文をお読みください。
	～～～～
	何かあるごとに、すぐに心配をしてくれる人がよくいます。
	そういう人を私たちは「やさしい人」と思うことがあります。
	でも、それはまちがいです。
	心配はたいへん悪いこと、マイナスのエネルギーを出すものです。
	顔見知りの誰かに、「あなた、顔が青いよ。どこか具合が悪いんじゃない」「早くお薬飲んで休まないとたいへんだよ」といわれたら、「ああ、そうかな。そういえば、ちょっと体がだるいし、熱っぽいかもしれない」という氣になります。
	そして、そんな忠告をしてくれた相手に「心配してくれて、ありがとう」と感謝します。
	でも、これは感謝するどころの話ではありません。
	マイナスエネルギーを頭からかけられたのと一緒だからです。
	「風邪をひいたのね。でも、大丈夫よ。すぐに治るから」という言い方をしてくれるのならいいのです。
	これは、プラスのエネルギーがいっぱいこもっている心くばりです。
	ところが、「放っておくとたいへんよ」「早く医者に行きなさい」というような言い方をされると、不安になってしまいます。
	自分ではそれほどでもないと感じているのに、大変な病氣にかかっているのではないかと恐怖におそわれます。
	そんな氣持ちを抱いていると、どこも悪くないのに、本当の病氣になってしまうこともあります。
	心配はマイナスのエネルギーを持っているというのは、こういう意味です。
	心配と心くばりは違います。
	あるとき、私の家に一人のおばあさんが訪ねていらっしゃいました。
	おばあさんは、「一つだけあなたに聞きたいことがあります」
	といわれ、こんな話をしはじめました。
	私の両親はとても宗教心のある人たちで、私も両親のような生き方をつづけてきました。
	自分の子供たちにも、怒ったり、人をだましたり、むさぼったりしないようにいってきました。
	お釈迦様の説かれたことは守るように努力してきました。
	それなのに、両親も私も幸せではありません。
	私は不幸せのまま死んでいくのは嫌です。
	あなたはこれをどう説かれますか？あなたの本にも、人をうらんだり、ねたんだり、だましたりしてはいけないと書いてありました。
	でも、そうやって生きているのに私は幸せになれないのです。
	私の本には、その答えも書いてあるはずでしたが、おばあさんはその部分を読んでおられないようです。
	そこで私は聞いてみました。
	「あなたのお母さんは人をねたんだり、うらんだりしなかったのね。むさぼることもなかったのね」
	「そうです。だから私もしませんでした」
	「ああ、そうなの。よかったわね。だけどね、一つ聞きますけれど、心配はどう？あなたは心配もなさらなかったの？」
	すると、おばあさんは答えました。
	「朝から晩まで心配ばかりしています。子供が出かければ交通事故に遭わないか、雨が降れば濡れないか、寒ければ風邪をひかないかと、朝から晩まで私の頭の中は心配ばっかりです」
	「その心配がいけないのですよ。あなたの心配があなたの人生をマイナス方向に向けてしまったのですよ」
	私がそういうと、おばあさんは怪訝（けげん）な顔をなさいました。
	「いや、私がしたのは心配ですよ。うらんだり、ねたんだり、むさぼったりじゃない。心配をしただけです」
	心配の意味をうまく理解できないようなので、私はさらにいいました。
	その心配がいけないんです。
	病氣のときに『××さんも同じような症状があったのに、ほっといてガンになったらしいですよ、私もあなたのことを心配しています』といったら、その人はどうなるでしょう。
	病氣はよくなりますか。
	もしかして自分もガンの前兆かもしれないと思うでしょう。
	心配は、人をどんどんマイナスに導いてしまうのですよ。
	あなたはご両親から心配のエネルギーをいっぱいふりかけられて、あなたもまたいっぱい心配をして、それを悪いことだとは思っていないようです。
	けれども、それは人をうらんだり、ねたんだり、むさぼったりするのと同じマイナスのエネルギーなんです。
	マイナスはマイナスを呼ぶのです。
	心配すれば心配が、心配しながら心配事を集めて心配にきます」
	私がこのように説明をすると、おばあさんはようやく納得されたように、こうおっしゃいました。
	「朝から晩まで心配の一日でした。心配をするということは、自分をへりくだり、人に親切にするやさしい言葉だと私は思っていました。私の親も同じように思っていたのでしょう」
	心配は無用です。
	心配したからといって、病氣も仕事もよくなるものではありません。
	これからは、大丈夫で生きましょう。
	『大丈夫、大丈夫』といつもいっていれば、それが神様に通じて、何でも大丈夫になりますよ。
	そして、その次は『ありがとうございます、ありがとうございます』というのです」
	私がそういうと、おばあさんは
	「わかりました。本当にそうですね」
	とホッとした表情を浮かべ、うなずいてくれました。
	そのときのお顔がとても印象的でした。
	心配はやさしさの表現ではありません。
	心配をするのなら、代わりに「大丈夫！！」と腹を決めて、「ありがとうございます」と感謝をする習慣をつけるように心がけましょう。
	心配の種が心に芽生えたら、すぐに「大丈夫」とささやきかけてください。
	明るく感謝して「大丈夫」で生きていけば、すべては好転していきます。
	なぜならば、それは宇宙のリズムに沿った生き方だからです。
	単純明快は神の心、複雑怪奇は悪魔のささやきなのです。

	もっとも強力な方法です。
	後述しますが、世界中の悪徳業者がいろいろな手段を用いてメールアドレスを収集しており、本人がいくら気をつけても知人の電話帳から自分のメールアドレスが流出する可能性があります。
	つまり時間が経つほどそのアドレスは迷惑メールの標的になりやすくなるため、変更することで完全なリセットが可能です。
	もちろん新しいアドレスを知人に通知する必要がありますが、その際に知人が指定したアドレスのみを受信する設定だった場合、メール以外の手段でアドレス変更を知らせなければいけません。
	２．【間接的対処】ｉＰｈｏｎｅへの迷惑メールの影響を減らす方法
	２－１．無料メールを活用し、キャリアメールの使用を限定する
	携帯キャリアのメールアドレス変更は少々手間ですよね。
	またスマホは基本的にメール着信がユーザーに通知されるため、メールの開封率がパソコンのメールにくらべ高い傾向にあります。
	だからこそ悪徳業者にとって、携帯キャリアのメールアドレスは美味しいターゲットなのです。
	であれば、携帯キャリアのアドレスをあえて使わず、無料で取得できるＧｍａｉｌ、Ｙａｈｏｏ！メールなどを、携帯メールがわりに使うという手があります。
	≪無料メールを使う４つのメリット≫
	１．無料でいくつでも取得できる

	そして収集されたアドレスはリスト化され、そのままインターネット上で販売されてます。
	アドレスの種類や属性（無料メールｏｒ携帯メールなど）によっても価格は変化しますが、一例として１０００アドレスで０．５ドル～１０ドル、１０万アドレスで７０ドル～１５０ドルほどで取引されています。
	また正規のサービスに登録したアドレスが、同意した規約の範囲内で別のサービスの情報送信に用いられるケースもあります。
	アドレス収集や迷惑メールのパターンなどは、『徹底解剖！迷惑メールの仕組みを全て知り、被害をなくす方法』で詳しく解説しています。
	４．まとめ
	ｉＰｈｏｎｅの迷惑メール対策と、迷惑メールが無尽蔵に送られ続ける仕組みを解説してきましたがいかがでしたか。
	将来的にはともかく、しばらくの間は迷惑メールがなくなることはないでしょう。
	だからこそ、対策と知識を持つことで快適にｉＰｈｏｎｅを使うことができるはずです。

	ｉＰｈｏｎｅに届く迷惑メールに悩まされているのなら、この記事があなたの力になれるかもしれません。
	多くのｉＰｈｏｎｅユーザーは、「メール」という初期搭載アプリで携帯アドレスのメールを送受信しているはずですが、このアプリには迷惑メールのフォルダ分け機能はありません。
	よって、迷惑メール対策は、各キャリアのサーバにユーザーログインして行いましょう。
	またそもそも携帯メールを使わずに済むコミュニケーション方法や、迷惑メールを誰がなんの目的で送信しているかという部分の話もしていきます。
	読み終わるころには、あなたのｉＰｈｏｎｅが迷惑メールに悩まされることもなくなるでしょう。
	１．【直接的対策】ｉＰｈｏｎｅへの迷惑メールを遮断する方法
	１－１．キャリアごとのサーバ設定で根元から絶つ
	＠ｄｏｃｏｍｏ．ｎｅ．ｊｐ、＠ｅｚｗｅｂ．ｎｅ．ｊｐ、＠ｉ．ｓｏｆｔｂａｎｋ．ｎｅ．ｊｐといった、携帯キャリアのメールをｉＰｈｏｎｅで受信する場合、ほとんどの人は最初からｉＰｈｏｎｅに入っており、キャリア側が設定方法を教えてくれる「メール」という純正アプリを使用しているのではないでしょうか。
	ｍａｉｌ
	このアプリはシンプルで使いやすいのですが、そのままでは迷惑メールを別のフォルダに振り分けたり、削除はできません。
	よって、ｉＰｈｏｎｅに到達する前に経由する、各キャリアのサーバで迷惑メールを排除することが有効です。
	キャリアによっては基本的な迷惑メール対策を行っていますが、積極的に対策するためには以下の方法でサーバにログインしましょう。

	そして営利目的とはいっても、通常の方法で売り込むことのできない怪しげなものを大量に拡散しているのが迷惑メールですから、上記のような怪しいメールを受信してしまっても、興味を持たずすぐに破棄すれば問題は起きません。
	言い替えれば、本文を読み、興味を持ってしまう人がいるかぎり、迷惑メールはなくなりません。
	また迷惑メールの送信は、ゾンビパソコンと呼ばれる犯罪者に秘密裏に操られているグループ化されたパソコンにより、常時送信されています。
	１分間で１０００通以上、１日に１００万通以上の迷惑メール送信を行うゾンビパソコンのグループも確認されています。

	２－２．ＬＩＮＥなどコミュニケーションできるアプリで代替
	そもそも迷惑メールが届くのは、メールアドレスがオフィシャルなものであり、アドレスさえ合致していれば、他人でも送信や受信ができてしまうからです。
	家族や友人とメッセージをやりとりするのなら、お互いが認可しあっていなければ通信できない、ＬＩＮＥ、カカオトーク、Ｓｋｙｐｅなどのコミュニケーションツールを使う手があります。
	また、Ｆａｃｅｂｏｏｋユーザー同士が通信できるメッセンジャーや、海外ではユーザーが非常に多いＷｈａｔｓＡｐｐも頼りになります。
	さらに、電話番号同士でメールをやりとりできるＳＭＳという選択肢もあります。
	３．なぜ迷惑メールがｉＰｈｏｎｅに届くのか

	※まずは前回の記事を読んでから、今回のアンケート作成のフェーズに入られることをおすすめします。
	（２）調査票（設問）設計のコツ
	１設問数が少ないほど、回答率は上がる
	あらかじめ目標設定した「サンプル数」が多ければ多いほど、設問数は少なめにした方がいいかもしれません。
	２個人情報の記載が必要ない方が、回答率は上がる
	アンケート回答者について個人の特定が必要な場合は、アンケートのフォーマットによって個人情報の取得方法が異なるので注意しましょう。

	スーツの素材について
	スーツでよく使われる素材についてです。
	カジュアルだと素材より見た目重視の方が多いでしょうが、スーツでは生地自体にもこだわって欲しいです。
	スーツは休日以外ほぼ毎日着るとなると私服よりもずっと着用時間は長くなります。
	そうなるとスーツへのダメージも増えていき、着こなしの大敵であるシワや、着用感の低下から印象も変わってきてしまいます。
	そのため各素材の特徴を知り自分に合った素材を選び、それらをなるべく防ぐことが日々の正しい着こなしにも繋がってくるのです。

	またシワになっても２、３日ハンガーにかけておくとほとんどシワが取れるので３着ほどをローテーションして着るようにするのがオススメです。
	予算が限られている方や出張が多い方はポリ混でできるだけウール１００％に近い見た目の生地にしましょう。
	見た目の判別のみで問題ないですが、基本的にウールの比率が多いとウール寄りの機能と見た目に、ポリエステルが多いとポリエステルよりの機能と見た目になります。
	まとめ
	まとめると、
	チャコールグレーの無地かピンストライプ
	ミディアムグレーの無地かピンストライプ
	ダークネイビーのピンストライプ
	で、ウール１００％の生地
	を、３着程度ローテーションが理想となります。
	もしスーツを１着もお持ちでない方はこのまま、何着かお持ちの方は買い足す際の参考にしていただければオーケーです。
	知識的な内容が多くなってしまったので、全て覚えずともポイントだけつかんで実践していただけたら幸いです。

	元気なように見えても、実は身体がだるい状態が続いている．．．．．．そんな悩みを抱えている人は少なくありません。
	そこで、身体のだるさに悩んでいるときのチェックポイントをまとめてみました。
	不調の原因を探ることで、倦怠感に対処していきましょう。
	チェック１．身体や心に過度の負担はありませんか？
	病気でもないのにだるい状態が続くのなら、身体や心に負担がかかっているかもしれません。
	原因となる出来事がなかったかどうか、ここ数日～数週間の生活を振り返ってみましょう。
	特に思い当たるフシがない場合でも、家事や育児、仕事などに追われる毎日を過ごすなかで知らないうちに疲れがたまり、だるさにつながっていることがあります。
	また、心の疲れをそのままにしておくと、うつ病のような心の病気につながる可能性も。
	特に、身体が鉛のように重くてだるいと感じているなら要注意です。
	身体と心に負担を感じたら、なるべく早めに十分な休息と睡眠をとりましょう。
	休息をとったのにまだ倦怠感がある場合は、何らかの病気が隠れている可能性も。
	あまり長く続くようなら、一度病院に相談してみましょう。
	チェック２．栄養は足りていますか？
	忙しいからと、ついつい毎日の食事をおろそかにしていませんか？実は、栄養不足がだるさにつながることもあるようです。
	特に、ビタミンＢ群が不足すると身体が疲れやすくなるので、豚肉や納豆、鶏レバーや牛乳といった食材を積極的に摂取するとよいですね。

	兄弟揃ってお祝いをしないといけないの？
	最近は、皆さんが遠く離れていて、ウマく足並みが揃わないこともありますよね。
	もちろん皆さん揃ってお祝いしてあげられれば一番良いのですが、無理をせず、ご兄弟で相談をして各々でお祝いをしてあげるのも良いと思います。
	ご家族が揃われるお正月やＧＷ、お盆などの機会を利用される方も非常に多いですね。
	私と旦那さんのお母さんが今年還暦なんですが．．．
	何も悩む必要はありません。
	同じようにお祝いをして上げましょう。
	もし、比較的近くで、お互いの交流があるようなら、一緒にお祝いすることも盛大で思い出深いお祝いになっていいかもしれませんね。
	ただ、その場合は各ご兄弟で、いろいろ調整することも必要かと思いますので、どなたかがしっかりと幹事をされる必要があるでしょうね。
	女性は還暦祝いをしなくていいのですか？
	還暦は一般的に男女による違いはありません。
	男性にも女性にも同じように還暦はあります。
	昔は家督を後継者に譲るという意味があったため、還暦のお祝いの対象は男性だけだったようです。
	そのため女性の還暦祝いはしない慣習が残っている地域もあるようですが、今では一般的に男女による違いはありません。
	でも、年齢を気にされる女性が多いんですよね。
	「還暦祝いをするよ」って言うより、「誕生日のお祝い」をすると言っておいて、実は「還暦祝い」なんてサプライズな演出もいかがでしょうか？！
	重大な病気の前触れとして、だるさや倦怠感が生じることがあります。
	疲労感・倦怠感を伴う病気の見極め方を詳しくお伝えします。

	そうそう、あとはお祝いする方が集まりやすい時！
	お正月やゴールデンウイーク、お盆休みなどご家族が揃われるタイミングにお祝いをされる方も多いですね。
	６０才で定年退職される方も多いので、ご勇退記念を兼ねてされる方もおられます。
	「還暦のお祝いにしようか、退職のお祝いにしようか悩んでるんです」ってご相談されることもあります。
	ご一緒にお祝いされる方は定年退職前にお祝いをされるなら還暦の祝い、定年退職直後にされるなら退職のお祝いにされたりしても良いかもしれませんね。
	色々なことを書きましたが、形にとらわれずお祝いしたいという気持ちが一番大切かと思います。
	６０歳の誕生日がある年で、参加者やもちろんご本人の都合が良い時にされればいいと思います。
	現在の６０歳の方はまだまだお若いです。
	６０歳の年を過ぎた場合でも、お誕生日やご家族が集まった際に６０歳の時にはできなかったけど、感謝の気持ちを届ける機会を設けるのも良いのではないでしょうか。
	形ではなくその気持ちが一番のプレゼントかと思います。

	還暦の贈物にはみんなさんからの感謝の気持を込められるものを選んであげましょう。
	普段使う物でも、記念に残る物でもいいと思いますが、渡すときに一言「今までありがとう。これからも元気でね！」って
	声をぜひかけてあげてください。
	その時の感動がきっと贈物を見るたびに思い出されるはずです。
	ご自宅でお祝いの席を設けるのなら、大きなものでもいいと思いますが、外での会食をされるのなら、持って帰りやすいものを選ぶのも良いかもしれませんね。
	離れて暮らしていて一緒にお祝いが出来ない時には、送ることになると思いますが、できればプレゼントを持ってお顔を見せてあげるのが一番かもしれませんね。
	もし、送られる場合はメッセージカードや、お手紙を入れたり、最近の写真を送ってあげたり、お顔が見えない分を補ってあげるお心遣いがあれば良いと思います。
	贈物の到着する頃に在宅されているか確認しておいてそれから到着の頃を見計らってお電話するなどすれば、お父さんやお母さんの喜びはさらに大きくなるものと思います。
	最高の還暦祝いプレゼント
	贈り物を選ぶときに注意することは？
	ご本人にとって実は還暦になることに抵抗がある方も多いようです。
	お父さんやお母さんの若い頃には「還暦の人＝お年寄り」の感覚が強くあるのだと思います。
	ですから、あまりお年寄り扱いになるような物は避けた方がいいかもしれませんね。

	どうやってお祝いするの？
	還暦祝いは満年齢で６０歳（数え年で６１歳）を迎えたことを喜ぶ元々は長寿を祝う行事でした。
	でも、今の６０歳の方は見た目も若いし、体力に自信のある方も多いので、長寿って感じじゃないですよね。
	仕事も現役で続けられている方も最近では増えていますもんね。
	それでも６０歳って人生の節目に当たるんですよね。
	仕事も一段落し、子供たちも社会へ出て家庭を持っていることも多いですし、もう家族のことを気にしなくてもいい頃なのではないでしょうか。
	それに、今は元気でも体のことを気にかけて欲しい頃でもありますよね。
	普段は口にしないけれど、ここまで育ててくれた感謝や、これからはできるだけ自分の為に時間を使って欲しいという想いや、健康に注意して欲しい気持を伝える機会でもあと思うんです。
	子供は親離れしているけれど、それに気が付いていなかったりするご両親に、「私達のことはもう大丈夫！これからは自分たちが楽しんでね」ってさりげなく伝えるちょうどいいタイミングなのではないでしょうか？
	還暦のお祝い方法に特に決まりはありません。
	けれど、いつもの誕生日とは違う特別な日にしてあげたいですよね。
	結婚式ほど大げさにとは言いませんが、想い出に残るものにしてあげたいものです。
	家族みんなで会食をしたり、旅行へ行くのもいいですよね。
	還暦のお祝いはいつすればいいの？
	還暦祝いは「数え年の６１歳」になったら行います。

	・（株）（略称の使用は不可、株式会社と書くべき、また、通称ではなく、フルネームで書くべき）

	２－２．報告書作成のポイント
	～文字量に着目する
	文字量に留意しながら報告書を作成すると、目的にあった上手な報告書が書けます。
	・一言で報告する場合＝５０字（＝１２～１３秒）にまとめる
	・簡潔に１分で報告する場合＝２００字
	・一般的な報告書を作る（要旨＋詳細内容）＝Ａ４用紙１枚で要旨、２枚～３枚で詳細内容
	２－３．報告書作成のポイント
	～文書表現の注意点
	●「ですます調」と「である調」の混同をしない
	一気に文書を書き上げた場合には、特に見直しが必要です。
	必ず読み直して、チェックしましょう。
	●助詞の重複を避ける
	同じ助詞が３回以上連続すると読みにくくなります。
	そのような場合は文章を分割する等、構成や表現を変えましょう。
	●句読点の打ち方

	３．報告書の具体的な書き方
	（１）標題
	文書の概要が一目で伝わるように１５～２０字で具体的に書きます。
	△「出張報告」
	△「安心メディカルへの出張の件」
	○「安心メディカル本社への「とるとる」販売に関する出張報告」
	日付、具体的な報告内容を標題に込めると内容を理解しやすくなります（よって、中身を詳しく読んでくれる事となります）。
	（２）本文
	簡潔に「標題（掲題）の件につき、下記の通り、ご報告いたします」と書きます。
	その後で、文書の場合は「記」と真ん中に記して、箇条書きで各項目を続ける（メールの場合は「記」を省略する）。
	最後は「以上」で締める。
	（３）状況説明
	状況説明は項目分けして箇条書きにして書きます。
	将来、万一、将来、トラブルが発生した場合には重要な証拠にもなりますので、あくまで正確に書いてください。

	（４）要旨の作り方～重要な内容を３つ程度でまとめる
	先に述べた通り、要旨は文章を作って、その内容を要約し、最後に作るべきものです。
	報告書に「内容要旨」が必要な理由は、読み手がそこを見て、すぐに報告書の「結果」（結論）が理解できるためです。
	報告書を読むのは、自分より立場が上で、忙しく、報告書の文書などで余計な時間を取りたくないと考えている方です。
	報告書の「内容要旨」は重要なことを３つ程度書く。
	分量としては３行程度（５０字程度）
	～人が一度に理解しやすい分量はこれぐらい。
	報告相手（上司）の知りたいことを書くよう心がける。

	２－４．報告書作成のポイント
	～報告書が完成すれば「声に出してチェックする」
	報告書を提出する際、口頭で内容を求められる事が多々あります。
	ですから、報告書の内容・枚数にかかわらず、一言（１５秒、５０文字）、１分（２００字程度）で内容を声に出して説明できるか確認すべきです。
	２－５．報告書作成のポイント
	～全体的な「見栄え」に注意する
	忙しい上司や顧客は、報告書を読むに値するかどうかを、資料の「ぱっと見の美しさ」からまず判断します。
	見栄えにも配慮があれば、内容もよく吟味され、確かだと見なされます。

	～ここがヌケていると甘い仕事とみなされます
	１こんな内容なら、上司はここを読むだけで内容が分かり、次の対応の判断を下すことが可能。
	もし、簡潔な報告書を求められたら、ここまでの内容で十分に報告書になります。
	２重要なのは、結果を報告するだけではなく、次に「どのようなアクションをするか」ということを報告書に盛り込むことです。
	【提出を受ける側から見た報告書のポイント】
	報告書を読んだ後、上司が次の行動にいち早く、そして確実に移るために必要な事柄が求められる。
	・「報告書は早く欲しい」
	・「課題は何か？を明確に書いて欲しい」
	～相当に「業務を知る」事がないと、課題は書けない。
	文書は「仕事を写す鏡」
	報告書作成のポイントを学べる研修はこちら
	【公開講座】報告書・議事録の書き方研修
	４．報告書の詳細な内容のポイント
	「詳細内容（ヒアリング事項等）」は、報告の「内容要旨」の部分を受けて、さらに詳細な内容を説明する所です。
	本文の形式
	「見出し」→「小見出し」→「説明文」の３つの階層をつけて書くとわかりやすい。
	○３つの関係
	「見出し」の説明が「小見出し」
	「小見出し」の詳細が「説明文」
	●逆に見れば
	「説明文」の要約が「小見出し」
	「小見出し」の要約が「見出し」
	～ビジネス文書全体がこの形になっている。

	５まとめ
	いかがでしたか。
	株価は市場が提供するとても重要な情報ですが、よりよく活用するにはもう少し踏み込んで理解する必要があります。
	そのためには次の３つをしっかり押さえておきましょう。
	●会社の株主の価値の合計である株式時価総額を理解する
	●株価の高・低と、株価が割高・割安であることは別にして考える
	●株価の割高・割安は、以下の２面からチェックする
	－過去の株価の水準と比べて現在の株価の位置はどこにあるのか、という考え方で割高・割安を判断する
	－株価収益率（ＰＥＲ）や株価純資産倍率（ＰＢＲ）を手掛かりに、株価が割高か割安かを考える。
	特に、同業他社との比較は重要。
	上記の３点を頭に入れた上で、新聞やインターネットの株式欄をチェックする習慣をつけてください。
	株式欄をチェックする際のおすすめは、新高値・新安値の銘柄をフォローすることです。
	市場の評価を上げている銘柄、あるいは下げている銘柄を定期的に見ることで、さまざまな株価の動きをより深く理解できるようになります。
	株価チャートとは？
	チャートとは１日、１週間、１ヶ月といった期間の株価をグラフ化して見やすくしたものです。
	ただ、株価を見ただけでは、安いか、高いかを判断できません。
	そんなときに参考として用いられます。
	また、相場のトレンドや過熱状態等を捉えるために活用することもできます。

	新聞の株価欄の活用法
	さて、以上のようなデータ、細かいなぁとお感じかもしれません。
	しかし始値、高値、安値、終値、前日比、売買高というデータは実はいろいろなチャートを作るときの入力データです。
	よって、この６つの数字から１日の値動きのポイントが分かります。
	投資家は「今日はいくらで始まり、どこまで上がり、どこまで下がり、結局どの水準で終わったのかな、売買は多かったのかな」とイメージし、その銘柄を積極的に買いたいのか売りたいのか判断しています。
	また、新聞の良さは網羅性です。
	すべての銘柄が掲載されていますので、定期的にこれを眺めていると、人気が出て買われている銘柄や業種、逆に人気がなくなり下げている銘柄や業種が見えてくるようになります。
	プロやベテランが活用しているテクニックの１つに、新高値・新安値の銘柄に着目するという手法があります。
	新聞ではこれをビジュアル的に一目で追うことができ、大変便利です。
	日本経済新聞などでは、新高値・新安値銘柄が黒ベタ白抜き（白い字）で示されているからです。
	高値の欄にこれがあるときは新高値がついたこと、安値の欄にこれがあるときは新安値がついたことが分かります。
	新高（安）値は、年初来一番高い（安い）株価のことを意味します（３月までは前年からの最高値、最安値）。
	新聞では、どの業種のどういう銘柄がその年の高値まで買われているのか、その年の安値で売られているのかが一目で俯瞰できます。
	株式市場の物色動向を知る一番身近な手がかりとして重宝しますので、新聞を購読されている場合はぜひ注目してください。

	■株価純資産倍率
	後者の代表的な指標は「株価純資産倍率」で、
	株価÷１株当たり純資産
	と計算します。
	純資産は会社の資産から負債を引いた残りです。
	これは企業のオーナーである株主全体のものです。
	資産－負債＝純資産
	この式を読み替えると、いま会社の資産（建物や工場や営業所や在庫など）を全て現金化し、借りている金額（負債）を全て返した時に、株主の手元に現金がいくら残るのかというふうに理解できるはずです。
	これを解散価値と呼ぶことがあります。
	この金額を発行済み株式数で割ったものが１株純資産で、これを株価と比較します。
	ＰＢＲ（ＰｒｉｃｅＢｏｏｋＶａｌｕｅＲａｔｉｏ）とも呼ばれます。
	この数値が高いほど、株価が解散価値を上回る人気・期待を集めているとして「割高」とみなされます。
	逆に、低いほど割安とみなされます。
	具体例で見ておきましょう。
	さきほどのトヨタとスズキの例で見ると、１．４倍と１．８倍となっていますので、スズキのほうが割高、トヨタは割安と言えます。
	ここで整理しておきましょう。
	リンゴの「価値」と言われると、単にリンゴの価格が大きいか小さいかではなく、その価格がそのリンゴの品質（等級）に対して高いのか低いのかを考えるはずですね。
	株価の「価値」も同じです。
	株価を「１株純利益」、「１株純資産」と比べて「ＰＥＲ」、「ＰＢＲ」を計算し、高いか低いかを見るべきです。
	さらに「ＰＥＲ」「ＰＢＲ」というものさしを使うと、異なる企業の株価の「割高」「割安」を比較できるようになります。
	株式投資では、多くの銘柄の中から「割安」な銘柄を探していくことが必要です。
	この銘柄選択の過程で、銘柄間の「割高」「割安」を示す指標は大変重要です。
	株取引をするにはＰＥＲとＰＢＲをしっかり理解するとよいでしょう。
	４新聞やインターネットの株価欄の情報を徹底活用する
	株価の見方の基本を押さえましたので、実践編に移りましょう。
	ここではメディアの株式情報の見方のポイントを説明します。
	新聞の株価欄の見方
	ここでは日本経済新聞の株式欄を例に説明します。
	日本経済新聞では東証第一部、第二部、マザーズ、ジャスダックなどの各市場について、上場されている銘柄（企業）を業種に分けて証券コード順に株価情報を提供しています。

	株式時価総額とは
	この２つ目の株価の見方には注意が必要です。
	確かに、良品計画の１株の価格はニトリの１株の価格より大きいことには違いありません。
	しかし、これはリンゴ１個の価格をミカン１個の価格と比べていることになり、意味はあまりないのです。
	多くの投資家は、むしろ良品計画の会社全体の大きさやニトリの会社全体としての大きさに注目しています。
	そこで、例として、良品計画という会社をリンゴの木、ニトリという会社をミカンの木と捉えてみましょう。
	それぞれの会社の大きさを、その木に実った果実の数全体とします。
	すると
	良品計画の大きさ＝リンゴ１個の価格×木全体のリンゴの数
	ニトリの大きさ＝ミカン１個の価格×木全体のミカンの数
	となります。
	会社の大きさは果実１個の価格と果実の数の両方で決まるのです。
	これを専門的には株式時価総額と呼びます。
	算出式は次の通りです。
	先ほどの例と同じ原理です。
	株価×発行済み株式数
	株式市場が会社全体の株式の価値をいくらとしているかは、この計算で求められるのです。
	言い方を変えると、その会社の株式を全部買い占めるにはどれぐらいのお金がかかるのかを示しています。
	さて、さきほどの例ですと、株価は良品計画のほうがニトリより大きい価格でした。
	しかし、時価総額はこの順序ではなく、良品計画は７０００億円、ニトリは１．１兆円ほどです。
	株価の大小は、異なる会社の間で比べても意味がありません。
	異なる会社を比べるためには、それぞれの木の果実の数と果実１個当たりの価格の両方を考える必要があります。
	３「株価の高低」と「株価の割高・割安」の違い
	異なる会社の株価を単純に比べるだけでは不十分だとお話しました。
	株式投資の立場で考えなければならないのは、どの会社が投資に値する価値があるか（一番大きいか）、ということです。
	これをリンゴとミカンに例えると、リンゴとミカンは今どちらが（より）お買い得か、お値打ちかという考え方になります。
	現在のリンゴとミカンの価格を比較するだけではお値打ちかどうかはわからないですね。
	リンゴとミカンに共通のものさしを当てはめて、どちらがお値打ちかを判断する必要があるのです。
	株価で「割高」「割安」という考え方もこれと同じです。
	その株価が割安であるということは、お値打ちがある、今の株価は本来あるべき値段よりも低い、という意味です。
	そこで、割高・割安を判断するために皆さんに是非知っておいていただきたい２つの視点を説明します。
	過去の株価推移から考える（チャート分析）
	第１の視点は、現在の株価は過去の株価の推移の中で高い水準なのか低い水準なのかです。
	先ほどの果物の例では、今年のリンゴの価格は過去の価格と比べて高いか低いかと考えるのと同じ思考方法です。
	特に１０年や２０年という長期で見てみると、株価は必ず上げたり下げたりしています。
	現在の株価が過去の株価の水準とどう違うのか見ておくことは大変有益です。
	仮に過去の推移と比べて現在の株価が低いなら、時系列の面で株価は「割安」と言えそうです。
	企業の財務指標と結び付けて考える（バリュエーション分析）
	第２の視点は、現在の株価をその会社の財務の数値に結びつける考え方で、一般にバリュエーション分析といいます。
	果物でいえば、等級と価格を比べることと一緒です。
	ここにはさらに２つの考え方があります。
	会社利益の水準から等級を割り出す考え方と、会社の純資産に関連付ける考え方です。
	■株価収益率
	前者で代表的な指標は「株価収益率」というもので、次の式で求めます。
	株価÷１株当たり純利益
	分子が１株の価格ですので、これに対応して分母も会社の利益全体を発行済み株式数で割って１株当たりの利益にします。
	略してＰＥＲ（ＰｒｉｃｅＥａｒｎｉｎｇｓＲａｔｉｏ）とも呼ばれます。
	この数値は「今の株価は、今の１株利益の何年分か」と解釈できます。
	この倍率が大きいほど、現在の株価は現在の１株利益の何倍も大きい水準にあるため、一般に「割高」とみなされています。
	株式投資家の人気が高く、将来への期待感が高い銘柄がこれに当たります。

	１－４．電源スイッチを押して反応するか
	電源スイッチを押して起動しようとした場合、Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓパソコンの多くの機種では「ピッ」という電子音が、Ｍａｃパソコンでは「ジャ～ン」という音が鳴って起動しはじめます。
	これらの音がそもそもしない場合には、電力の供給に何らかの問題があると考えられます。
	動かなくなったタイミングは？
	２．状態を確認したら原因を特定する
	状態によって、いろいろわかることがあります。
	でも、原因を即断するのは危険です。

	この場合は「パソコンが入力を求めていたことについて、私たちが気付かなかったこと」が動かなくなった原因ということになります。
	つまり、パソコンの「入力待機」が原因です。
	２－１－２．マウスポインターの動作確認
	画面内に特別な表示が見あたらない場合、パソコンが本当に止まってしまっていることがあります。
	マウスを動かして「マウスポインター（マウスに連動する画面内の矢印）」が動くかどうかを確認してください。
	マウスポインターが動作しない場合、何らかのトラブルが原因です。
	また、同じようにキーボードの動作も確認してましょう。
	Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓパソコンであれば「Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓキー」を押して、スタートメニューまたは、スタート画面が表示がされるかを確認してください。
	Ｍａｃの場合には、「Ｃｏｍｍａｎｄ」キーを押しながら「Ｔａｂ」キーを押してみて、ウィンドウ画面が切り替わるかを確認します。
	マウスが動作しないのにキーボードでは操作できる場合は、パソコンではなくマウスのトラブルです。
	これにはいくつかの対処方法があります。

	４．最後に
	ここまで「パソコンを壊したら数万円、十数万円の損害がでますよ」というように話を進めてまいりましたが、問題としてこれらはまだ「お金を出せば解決する」ので、深刻度の点ではまだそれほどではないのです。
	パソコンに取り込んだ「家族との思い出の写真」や「旧友や大事な顧客とやりとりした電子メール」などは、いくらお金を出しても二度と手に入れることができないものです。
	パソコンを使うときには「短気は損気」を肝に銘じておきましょう。
	大切なデータを失う悲しさは、実際に経験しないとわからないものなのです。
	フリーズした場合の確認事項
	フリーズしたときには、まずマウスやキーボードが使えるかどうかを確認します。
	これらが使える場合は、まだ復帰できる可能性があります。
	そして、本当にフリーズしているのかどうかを判断しましょう。
	フリーズしたときの確認事項
	フリーズしたときの確認事項
	１－１：フリーズしているかどうかを確認する
	「固まった」と思ったら、まずはしばらく放置してみましょう。
	大きなファイルを開いたときや、ソフトウェアが複雑な計算をしているときなど、非常に重い処理をしているときには、フリーズしたと思うくらいに動作が重くなります。
	まずは少し待ってみて、それでもまったく変化がないときにはフリーズしていると判断し、次の行動に移ります。
	この際、処理の進行状況を表示するプログレスバーが少しでも動いているかどうかが判断材料のひとつになります。
	なお、一度スリープさせるという方法もあります。
	ノートパソコンであれば、一度ディスプレイを閉じてスリープさせてみましょう。
	しばらく置いて再びディスプレイを開くことで復帰できる場合があります。
	デスクトップパソコンにも「スリープ」メニューがありますが、これはマウスやキーボードが動く場合に限られます。
	２：マウスやキーボードが操作できる場合
	マウスやキーボードが動く場合には、試す方法があります。
	フリーズの多くは、ソフトウェアのコンフリクト（競合）が原因です。
	これは、特定の機能やデータを複数のソフトウェアが取り合うときに発生します。
	このため、使用してない起動中のソフトウェアを終了させていきます。
	２－１：ソフトウェアを終了する
	終了（×）ボタンを押してもソフトウェアを終了できないときは、「タスクマネージャー」を使って終了させていきます。

	３－２．フリーズしている場合
	フリーズの場合は、ほとんどの操作ができません。
	まずは電源スイッチを軽く押してパソコンが停止できるか試してみましょう。
	軽く押して停止できない場合は、電源スイッチを「パソコンが停止するまで押す（「電源ボタン長押し」と呼びます）」ことが必要になります。
	機種によっては「リセットボタン」があるものもあります。
	取扱説明を確認しておきましょう。
	ただし、この操作をフリーズ以外で行うと、コンピューター自体に深刻なダメージをあたえることがあります。
	ハードディスクの動作ランプが完全に停止しているかを確認してから実行しましょう。
	また、メーカーやお店のサポートなど、プロにまかせるのもひとつの方法です。
	３－３．電源供給以外で起動しない場合
	ここまでのチェック、対処でもパソコンが動かない場合、ユーザーにできることはあまりありません。
	メーカーに修理を依頼するか、買い換えを検討しましょう。
	いずれにしても、パソコンに保存してあったさまざまなデータは消去されてしまいますので、バックアップを取っておきましょう。
	とはいえ、パソコンは動かないのですから、最新のバックアップを取ることはできません。
	これまでにバックアップをとっておいたかどうかが頼りになります。
	普段からバックアップを習慣づけておきましょう。
	バックアップについてはこちらの記事も参照してください。
	大切なデータを復元！万が一に備えたＰＣのパックアップ方法
	これはメーカーに修理を依頼する場合でも同様です。
	運良くデータが消去されなければよいのですが、それはまれだと考えましょう。

	４－３：ウイルスに感染していないかチェックする
	ウイルスに感染していることが原因で、パソコンがフリーズすることもあります。
	フリーズから回復したら、セキュリティソフトでウイルススキャンを実行しましょう。
	４－４：ハードディスクのデフラグを行う
	ハードディスクのデータが断片化している場合にも、処理に長い時間がかかったり、フリーズしてしまうことがあります。
	ハードディスクのデフラグを行って、ディスク内のデータを最適化しましょう。
	なお、ドライブにＳＳＤ（ＳｏｌｉｄＳｔａｔｅＤｒｉｖｅ）を使用している場合は、デフラグの必要性はないとされています。
	４－４－１：ハードディスクのデフラグ
	Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓの場合は、デフラグを実施したいドライブをエクスプローラーで表示し、ドライブを右クリックして［プロパティ］をクリックします。
	プロパティ画面が表示されるので、［ツール］タブから［最適化］をクリックして実行します。
	ハードディスクのデフラグ
	ハードディスクのデフラグ
	Ｍａｃの場合は、基本的にＯＳがデフラグを自動実行しますので、ユーザーが行う必要はないとされています。
	４－５：電源コンセントをチェックする
	電源が不安定な場合にも、フリーズすることがあります。
	電源ケーブルがしっかりとパソコンやコンセントに接続されているか、タコ足配線していないかなども確認しましょう。
	４－６：最悪の場合はＯＳを再インストールする
	上記の対策を行ってもフリーズしてしまうようなときは、最後の手段としてＯＳを再インストールしましょう。
	多くの場合、いったん初期状態にすることで、フリーズが解消されます。
	余裕があれば、必要最小限のソフトウェアや周辺機器を追加しながら様子を見ていくことで、原因を特定できる可能性があります。
	また、Ｗｉｎｄｏｗｓでは「ＢＩＯＳ」、Ｍａｃでは「ＥＦＩ」と「ＳＭＣ」といった、パソコンのマザーボードという基本的なパーツで動作するファームウェアというソフトウェアがアップデートされている場合があり、このアップデートによって不具合が解消することがあります。
	ただし、ファームウェアのアップデートに失敗するとパソコンが起動できなくなることもありますので、購入したショップなどに相談しましょう。
	５：最後に
	パソコンがフリーズしてしまうと、元の状態に復帰することが難しくなります。
	ほとんどの場合は、強制終了して再起動することで復帰できますが、その際に保存されていなかったデータは失われてしまいます。
	たとえば長文のブログを書いていたり、仕事用の資料を作成する場合などは、こまめにファイルを保存して被害を最小限に抑えるよう工夫しましょう。

	２－２：周辺機器を取り外す
	外付けドライブを接続したとき、外付けハードディスクにデータをコピーしているとき、外付け光学ドライブのディスクのフォーマットをしているときなどは、比較的フリーズの発生率が高いようです。
	これは、外付けドライブ用のドライバソフトに原因というケースが多くあります。
	ドライバソフトとは、パソコンに接続したドライブを認識し、操作を可能にするソフトです。
	これは標準的なものがパソコンのＯＳに用意されていますが、ドライブのメーカーがドライバソフトを提供している場合もあります。
	その場合はメーカー製のドライバを使うようにしましょう。
	外付けドライブが原因と思われる場合は、ひとまずドライブを取り外して、様子を見てみましょう。
	この際、ドライブのアクセスランプが消えたままの状態であることを確認しましょう。
	アクセスランプが点滅している状態でドライブを外すと、外付けドライブに保存されているデータが破壊されることがあります。
	３：マウスやキーボードが操作できない場合
	マウスやキーボードが動かない場合には、復帰が難しくなります。
	この場合は基本的にパソコンを強制終了することになりますが、その際には保存していないデータが消えてしまいます。
	文書や表計算ソフトなどでファイルを作成している場合は、こまめに保存するクセをつけましょう。
	なお、マイクロソフトの「Ｏｆｆｉｃｅ」などは自動バックアップ機能がありますので、再起動後にある程度の復元が可能です。
	３－１：コネクタを確認する
	まずは、マウスやキーボードの接続コネクタが外れかかっている可能性もあります。
	コネクタの接続を確認するとともに、ケーブルが無理に曲がっていないかなども確認しましょう。
	ワイヤレスのマウスやキーボードの場合には、電池切れも疑ってみます。
	３－２：強制終了する
	マウスやキーボード、周辺機器などがしっかり接続されている場合には、強制終了してみましょう。
	マウスもキーボードも操作できないため、本体の電源ボタンを長押しします。
	一定時間、電源ボタンを押していると終了します。
	また、リセットボタンのある機種では、リセットを試してみることも有効です。
	電源ボタンでも終了できない場合には、最後の手段として電源ケーブルをコンセントから抜きます。
	パソコンは電気で動く機械ですから、電源が断たれると当然ながら終了します。
	なお、ノートパソコンの場合は、電源ケーブルをコンセントから外しても内蔵バッテリーから電力が供給されているので、バッテリーも外しましょう。

	４：フリーズから回復したらやるべきこと
	フリーズから解放されて再起動をしても、そのままでは再びフリーズが発生する可能性があります。
	そこで、再起動をしたらチェックしたいポイントを以下に挙げてみました。
	４－１：ソフトウェアを最新にする
	ソフトウェアは定期、不定期にアップデートが行われています。
	アップデートのたびに不具合も修正されていきますので、こまめにアップデートが出ていないかをチェックし、最新版が公開されていたら適用しましょう。
	多くの場合、「設定」や「ヘルプ」メニューから確認できます。
	なお、マイクロソフト製品やアドビ製品など、自動更新機能のあるソフトウェアもあります。
	「秀丸」の場合は［その他］メニューからチェック
	「秀丸」の場合は［その他］メニューからチェック
	４－２：ドライバソフトを最新にする
	ソフトウェアと同様に、ドライバソフトも不定期にアップデートされます。
	アップデートの多くは対応機器の更新などですが、コンフリクトなどの不具合が確認されたときも修正されるので、フリーズが発生した後はドライバの更新を試しましょう。
	４－２－１：ドライバソフトの更新
