	幅の広いＩ型のコンクリート軌条の上面にあわせて、車体の中心線下に２本のタイヤが並列で配置され、これによって車体を支えています。
	車体を支える車輪であることから、一般的に支持輪と呼ばれています。
	日本跨座式では、この支持輪に動力伝達が行われ走行します。
	上の写真では、画面中央上に車体を支えるゴムタイヤが見えます。
	画面右手にある横向きの車輪は、案内輪です。
	支持輪を隠している太い筒状のものは、モーターです。
	下の写真は、モーターの推進軸に取り付けられているディスクブレーキです。
	モノレールは、ゴムタイヤで走行しますが、電車の仲間です。
	電車である以上、動力は電気です。

	走行にはゴムタイヤが使用され、Ｉ型のレールを両側から挟みこむようにゴムタイヤは配置されています。
	また、単に両側から挟みこむだけでは安定しないので、上下２段、２対のゴムタイヤが配置され、走行の安定性を保証しています。
	このようにして、１本だけの不安定なレールの上を、安定して走ることが出来るのです。
